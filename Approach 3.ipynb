5similarly for the uncrosslinked peg2kpei and peg2kpeissnanogels indicating a complete protection against extracellular matrix', ' so the results suggest that the crosslinking reaction provides convenient networks to capture antimir21and lessen displacement induced by heparin sulfate', ' althoughthere are generally more accessible cationic amines in the uncrosslinked polycation peg2kpei than the nanogels peg2kpeiss and peg2kcmpeiss to condense and neutralize negative charges of antimir21 the instability is less prominentfor peg2kpeiss nanogel possibly due to adequacy of the network
