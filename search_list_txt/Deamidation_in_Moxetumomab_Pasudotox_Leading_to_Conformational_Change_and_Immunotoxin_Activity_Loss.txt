Asparagine (Asn) deamidation is a common posttranslational modiﬁcation in which Asn is converted to
aspartic acid or isoaspartic acid. By introducing a negative charge, deamidation could potentially impact
the binding interface and biological activities of protein therapeutics. We identiﬁed a deamidation
variant in moxetumomab pasudotox, an immunotoxin Fv fusion protein drug derived from a 38-kDa
truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE38) for the treatment of hairy-cell leukemia. Although the deamidation site, Asn-358, was outside of the binding interface, the modiﬁcation had a signiﬁcant impact on
the biological activity of moxetumomab pasudotox. Surprisingly, the variant eluted earlier than its unmodiﬁed form on anion exchange chromatography, which often leads to the conclusion that it has a
higher positive charge. Here we describe the characterization of the deamidation variant with differential
scanning calorimetry and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, which revealed that the
Asn-358 deamidation caused the conformational changes in the catalytic domain of the PE38 region.
These results provide an explanation for why the deamidation affected the biological activity of moxetumomab pasudotox and suggest the approach that can be used for process control to ensure product
quality and process consistency.

Introduction
Since the approval of recombinant human insulin by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1982, the use of therapeutic
proteins for the treatment of many diseases and disorders,
including cancer, autoimmune and inﬂammatory disorders, and
metabolic, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases, has grown
tremendously.1,2 Protein-based biopharmaceuticals often have
higher speciﬁcity and therefore lower potential to cause adverse
effects and immune responses than small-molecule drugs, but they
also present their own challenges.2 One of the most critical of these

challenges is the chemical degradation that may occur during the
manufacturing and storage of most therapeutic proteins, which
leads to one or more posttranslational modiﬁcations (PTMs).2,3
Asparagine (Asn) deamidation, one of most common nonenzymatic PTMs, has long been considered to be a major degradation
pathway for many monoclonal antibodies and other therapeutic
proteins.4 It is generally believed that under neutral and basic
conditions, the reaction goes through a ﬁve-membered cyclic succinimide intermediate, which then hydrolyzes and yields both
isoaspartic acid and aspartic acid (Asp).5-7
It has been reported that Asn deamidation could have a significant impact on the biological activity of therapeutic proteins. For
example, in a study of dornase alpha, a recombinant enzyme used
for the treatment of cystic ﬁbrosis, deamidation of a single Asn
residue resulted in loss of its biological activity.8 Deamidation was
also reported to compromise antibody colloidal stability and to
increase aggregation under low-pH conditions.9 Especially in light
of the relationship between protein structure and function, detailed
structural characterization is essential to understand the molecular
basis of such reactions.

Hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS)
has emerged as a useful tool to monitor the conformation and
dynamics of therapeutic proteins.10-13 Conventional biophysical
techniques such as circular dichroism and ﬂuorescence14-16 provide
only general information, and it is difﬁcult to detect subtle
conformational changes or changes related only to speciﬁc regions
of proteins with these techniques. In contrast, HDX-MS can be used
to detect and localize the impact of PTMs on the structure of proteins at the peptide level, or even at the residue level. For example,
HDX has been used to study Asp isomerization and methionine
oxidation in complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies. Although they are only one amino acid apart in sequence,
these two modiﬁcations have been found to result in opposing
conformational impacts on local and nearby regions, leading
directly to different alterations on antibody-antigen binding afﬁnity.17 It has also been reported that oxidation of a CDR tryptophan
residue signiﬁcantly reduces antigen binding afﬁnity, and HDX-MS
data have revealed that the modiﬁcations increase the ﬂexibility of
variable regions and disrupt local conformation.18 Although a
similar experiment with Asn deamidation revealed no measurable
local conformational changes caused by the modiﬁcation, this
ﬁnding may have been compromised by the low deamidation levels
(~30%) in the material used in the study.19
A few studies have explored how Asn deamidation affects the
three-dimensional structure of proteins.20-25 Deamidation of human norovirus capsid protein has been reported to attenuate glycan
binding, and HDX-MS data have revealed localized alterations in
protein ﬂexibility, supporting ﬁndings from nuclear magnetic
resonance and X-ray crystallography studies.26 In another HDX-MS
study, deamidation was reported to slow Curli amyloid-protein
aggregation.11
Moxetumomab pasudotox (formerly CAT-8015) is a recombinant immunotoxin therapeutic protein developed for the treatment
of B-cell malignancies27 that received FDA approval in September
2018 for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory hairycell leukemia who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, including treatment with a purine nucleoside analog.28,29 It is
composed of a 38-kDa truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE38)
that is genetically fused to the variable fragment (Fv) of an antiCD22 antibody. When bound to CD22, a B-lymphocyteespeciﬁc
cell surface protein, it is rapidly internalized and processed. The
Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) catalyzes the transfer of ADP ribose
from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to eukaryotic
elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which inhibits protein translation and
leads to cell death. Deamidation in the catalytic domain of PE38 at
Asn-358 has previously demonstrated signiﬁcantly reduced biological activity in cell-based bioassay,30 but it remains unclear how
a single residue modiﬁcation could have such a marked impact on
the cytotoxicity of the molecule. Another puzzling observation is
that the deamidated species eluted before the major product peak
on a positively charged anion exchange column, despite the fact
that Asn deamidation introduces an extra negative charge.
In this work, Asn-358edeamidated moxetumomab pasudotox
was ﬁrst isolated using ion exchange chromatography (IEC). The
structural impact of deamidation was carefully examined by both
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and HDX-MS, which
showed alteration of the conformation of the PE catalytic domain.
In the comprehensive functional studies described here, we gained
a deep understanding of why the single deamidation diminished
biological activity and appeared as a basic variant, an early elution
peak in anion exchange chromatography. After evaluation of the
results from our stability study and the refolding process, a control
strategy was established and implemented in the commercial
manufacture process to minimize the deamidation level and to
maintain process and product consistency.

Materials and Methods
Moxetumomab Pasudotox
Recombinant moxetumomab pasudotox used in this study was
expressed in Escherichia coli strains and was puriﬁed at AstraZeneca
(Gaithersburg, MD) as previously described.31 All other commercial
chemicals were reagent grade or better. Peptide mapping and cellbased bioassay methods were employed as previously described.30
IEC Fractionation
IEC fractionation was performed on a 1200 HPLC system
equipped with a PL-SAX strong anion exchange column
(4.6  50 mm, 8 mm, 1000 Å; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Mobile phase
A was composed of 10 mM Tris and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pH 8.0, and mobile phase B was composed of 10 mM
Tris, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.0.
For each experiment, 500 mL of moxetumomab pasudotox starting
material at a concentration of 1 mg/mL was loaded on the system
and eluted with a linear gradient of up to 80% mobile phase B at a
ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The eluted protein was monitored by ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm, and two fractions (pre-peak and
main peak) were collected with a fraction collector. The fractions
from multiple injections were pooled together and buffer
exchanged with 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, to a ﬁnal

three-dimensional structures of PE38 were drawn based on the
structure 1IKQ from the Protein Data Bank.

concentration of approximately 1 mg/mL. The purity of IEC fractionation was veriﬁed by injecting 25 mg of starting material and
5 mg of each fraction on the anion exchange column.

A surface plasmon resonanceebased characterization assay was
used to measure the kinetic binding afﬁnity (equilibrium dissociation constant [KD]) of moxetumomab pasudotox for human CD22.
An anti-his tagged antibody was immobilized to two ﬂow cells of a
sensor chip, using a standard amine coupling procedure. A reference surface was created by omitting the capture of CD22 on one
ﬂow cell. A dilution series of moxetumomab pasudotox was prepared and then injected in a serial-ﬂow fashion across the reference
surface and the CD22 surface, followed by regeneration of both ﬂow
cells. The data were reference ﬂow cell subtracted and buffer
blanked and then ﬁt to a 1:1 binding model, using Biacore Evaluation software (Precision Antibody, Columbia, MD). This model
yields an association rate constant (ka) and a dissociation rate
constant (kd). The KD for the interaction between moxetumomab
pasudotox and CD22 was determined by the equation KD ¼ kd/ka.
Internalization Assay

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
DSC experiments were performed with a Microcal VP-Capillary
DSC instrument (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, PA) at a concentration of approximately 1 mg/mL. A scan rate of 60  C per hour was
used with temperatures ranging from 20  C to 100  C. Results were
analyzed with Origin 7.0 Microcal plug-in software (Malvern Instruments). Concentration-normalized data were ﬁtted to a nonetwo-state model with two peaks to calculate melting temperature
and calorimetric enthalpy of the individual domains after subtracting the heat capacity of the reference buffer.

Kinetic imaging analysis was used to determine whether moxetumomab pasudotox IEC pre-peak material was internalized into
B-lymphoma cells. Moxetumomab pasudotox was conjugated with
Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA) and was
bound to Daudi cells. The internalization of moxetumomab pasudotox was monitored with confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy.
Quantitative assessment of kinetic images of the cell membrane
and cytoplasm over time demonstrated the internalization of
moxetumomab pasudotox into the cytoplasm.
ADP Ribosylation Assay

HDX-MS Analysis
HDX-MS analysis was performed by using Waters HDX Technology (Waters, Milford, MA). Both IEC pre-peak and main peak
fractions were concentrated to 4 mg/mL prior to the HDX experiment. Samples containing 2 mL each were diluted 10-fold with
either H2O buffer (25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) or D2O buffer
(25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) at 25  C. After incubation for
0 (undeuterated), 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, and 120 min, the labeled
samples were quenched by adding 20 mL of ice-cold quench buffer
[7.2 M guanidine, 500 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride, pH 2.4] and were then further diluted with 120 mL of icecold 0.1% formic acid solution. Immediately, 50 mL of diluted samples was digested using an Enzymate Pepsin Column (5 mM,
2.1  30 mm; Waters) at 20  C. The peptic fragments were collected
with an Acquity BEH C18 VanGuard Pre-column (2.1  5 mm;
Waters) and eluted into an Acquity BEH C18 column (1.7 mm,
1.0  100 mm; Waters) at 0  C. Peptides separated on the column
were analyzed with a Xevo G2-XS QToF mass spectrometer (Waters). Data analysis was performed as previously described,23 and

An ADP ribosylation assay was used to evaluate the ADP ribosylation activity of moxetumomab pasudotox in vitro. Moxetumomab pasudotox reference standard and test samples were
serially diluted in ultrapure nuclease-free water and incubated
with an ADP ribosylation assay system containing eukaryotic eEF2,
NADþ, luciferase mRNA, complete amino acids mixture, RNase inhibitor, and wheat germ extract in a 96-well plate for 2 h at ambient
temperature. After incubation, an equal volume of Steady Glo
Luciferase assay buffer and substrate (Promega, Madison, WI) was
added to each well, and the plate was incubated at ambient temperature with gentle shaking for 30 min before the luminescence
was read on a plate reader. The amount of luminescence detected in
each well was directly proportional to the amount of translated
luciferase protein, which was inversely proportional to the amount
of ADP ribosylation of eEF2 by moxetumomab pasudotox. The test
sample would be considered active if inhibition of luciferase mRNA
translation was similar to that in the moxetumomab pasudotox
reference standard. If there was no inhibition of luciferase mRNA
translation, the sample would be inactive.

(black). The gray vertical bars represent the summed difference from all time points. Dashed lines mark ± 0.3 Da, the determined standard deviation for each exchange time point.

Results and Discussion
Separation and Identiﬁcation of Asn-358 Deamidated Variant
IEC analysis of moxetumomab pasudotox starting material led to
a two-peak proﬁle, indicating the presence of two charge variants
(Fig. 1a). The elution time of these variants (10.0 min and 12.5 min)
were consistent with those in previous studies,21,30 so these two IEC
peaks were termed “pre-peak” and “main peak.” Successful
enrichment of two variants was conﬁrmed (Fig. 1b and c), and
subsequent peptide mapping analysis revealed that the pre-peak
fraction was mainly Asn-358 deamidated moxetumomab pasudotox (97.5%), whereas the main peak fraction contained only 9.6%
deamidated Asn-358. Other deamidation site, Asn-243, showed no
signiﬁcant difference in deamidation levels between the two IEC
fractions. Non-reducing peptide mapping results showed the same
disulﬁde bond linkages for both pre-peak and main peak.
DSC Study
As a technology that can monitor the thermal unfolding transitions of a protein, DSC provided the ﬁrst insight on the structural

impact of Asn-358 deamidation. DSC measurements of both the
pre-peak and the main peak fractions showed two distinct transitions, the ﬁrst at ~44  C and the second at ~78  C (Fig. 2 and
Table 1). Native trypsin digestion of moxetumomab pasudotox was
used to assign the ﬁrst peak to unfolding of the PE38 domains and
the second peak to the Fv domain (see Supplementary Figs. S1, S2,
S3 and Table S1), which is consistent with previous ﬁndings.32
Comparison of the two DSC proﬁles revealed that both fractions
shared similar melting transition points for the Fv domain, but the
PE38 domain of the pre-peak fraction showed a decrease of 1.3  C in
melting temperature and a 15-kcal loss in enthalpy compared with
the main peak fraction. These results suggest that Asn-358 deamidation had no effect on Fv thermal stability but slightly destabilized the PE38 region, indicating the possible conformation
change in PE38.
HDX-MS Analysis
To further localize the conformational change caused by Asn-358
deamidation, HDX-MS was employed to analyze the two IEC fractions. A total of 182 peptic peptides were identiﬁed during the HDX
data processing, and the standard deviation for each exchange time

point was determined to be ±0.3 Dalton (Da). Among all identiﬁed
peptides, 14 were from the variable domain of the light chain (LC),
resulting in 81% of the LC sequence coverage. Both fractions had
superimposable exchange kinetic curves for the peptide LC 37e47
(Fig. 3a), indicating no conformational difference in this peptide
region. Similar results were also observed for the other 13 LC peptides. To gain a global view of the LC, the differences in deuterium
incorporation between the two fractions were calculated for all the
LC peptides (Fig. 3b). It is clear that all these differences were smaller
than 0.3 Da and were insigniﬁcant, so it was concluded that there
was no structural difference between the two IEC fractions in the LC,
which is consistent with similar DSC melting temperatures
observed from the second thermal transition.

The rest of the 168 peptides were identiﬁed to provide 96%
sequence coverage of the variable heavy and PE38 domains (VHPE38, also referred to as heavy chain [HC]), and their HDX-MS data
were more complex than those from the LC. First, consistent with
the LC, all peptides located in the Fv region (residues HC1e129)
showed no difference between the two fractions; exchange kinetic
curves of peptides HC52e69 are shown as an example in Fig. 3a.
Second, most peptides in the PE38 region (residues HC130e476)
showed no or only minor differences (0.3 Da) in deuterium uptake between the pre-peak and the main peak fractions, suggesting
that no signiﬁcant conformational difference was caused by Asn358 deamidation in most of the PE38 region. Finally, obvious differences were observed for peptides associated with four regions

Plausible Mechanism for Biological Activity Loss

(HC270e280, HC301e315, HC334e362, and HC428e455). The
peptides in regions HC267e275, HC301e307, HC341e361, and
HC428e454 all exhibited higher deuterium uptake in the pre-peak
fraction than in the main peak fraction (Fig. 3a), and all other
peptides related to these regions showed similar differences
(Fig. 3c). The differences at many exchange time points were
greater than 0.3 Da, and a few were as high as 2.5 Da. These results
indicated that some local conformational changes led to less protection against deuterium exchange in these regions.
One limitation of the differences shown in Fig. 3c is that the
peptide length was not considered. Longer peptides sometimes
show more signiﬁcant differences than short ones because they can
accumulate more backbone amide deuterium, and back-exchange
can easily overwhelm the exchange on shorter peptides. To take
the peptide length into account, the differences in deuterium uptake by PE38 peptides between the two fractions were divided by
the total number of the exchangeable amide hydrogens in each
peptide, depicted as colors in the heat map (Fig. 4). This heat map
clearly highlights the four PE38 regions in which the pre-peak
fraction showed signiﬁcantly higher deuterium uptake than the
main peak fraction. Overall, the HDX data suggest that Asn-358
deamidation had no impact on the Fv region but did change local
conformation in four regions in PE38. Considering that these regions account for only ~24% of the total PE38 sequence, these data
are consistent with the 1.3  C difference in the DSC melting temperature in the ﬁrst transition.
In addition, careful examination of the sequence revealed that
these HDX-deﬁned regions contained a total of ﬁve arginine residues. Because the HDX data suggested that these regions gained
more solvent accessibility due to the deamidation of Asn-358, the
deamidated moxetumomab pasudotox molecules might expose
more positive charges that overcome one negative charge from
Asn-358 deamidation. This would explain why the deamidated
species eluted before the unmodiﬁed ones on a positively charged
anion exchange column.

As a truncated form of PE, PE38 contains part of the expression
improvement domain (domain Ib), the translocation domain
(domain II), and the ADP ribosyltransferase enzyme domain
(domain III) as shown in Supplementary Fig. S4 sequence alignment
of PE and PE38 domains. The ﬁnding that all four HDX-deﬁned
regions were in domain III suggested that the deamidation of
Asn-358 (Asn-495 in PE) led to the misfolding of the catalytic
domain and reduction of the biological activity of moxetumomab
pasudotox. In a previous structural study of the complex eEF2-PE,
eEF2 mainly bound to 486e493, 576e580, and Arg-412 of PE.33
When the HDX heat map and these eEF2 binding interfaces were
superimposed on the crystal structure of PE in our study (Fig. 5), it
became obvious that the eEF2 binding interface completely overlapped with the four HDX-deﬁned regions 270e280, 301e315,
334e362, and 428e455 (407e417, 438e452, 471e499, and
565e592 in PE, see Supplementary Fig. S4 for sequence alignment
of PE and PE38). Furthermore, ﬁve of nine residues that constructed
the NAD binding interface were also located in these HDX-deﬁned
regions (Fig. 5b).34 All of these results suggest that the conformational changes resulting from Asn-358 deamidation disrupted
binding of moxetumomab pasudotox to eEF2 and NAD, which led to
loss of PE38-mediated cell-killing biological activity.
This proposed mechanism is supported by observations from
further biological characterization of the IEC pre-peak fraction
(Table 2). The target binding results indicate that the IEC pre-peak
material is capable of binding to the soluble CD22 with an afﬁnity
similar to that of the main peak, indicating that deamidation of
PE38 at residue Asn-358 does not have an impact on binding to the
CD22. Kinetic imaging analysis was used to determine whether the
moxetumomab pasudotox IEC pre-peak material was internalized
into B-lymphoma cells. Quantitative assessment of kinetic images
of the cell membrane and cytoplasm over time demonstrated the
internalization of moxetumomab pasudotox into the cytoplasm.

The IEC pre-peak material was internalized into the cells with kinetics similar to those of the moxetumomab pasudotox starting
material (Supplementary Fig. S5). The ADP ribosylation activity of
moxetumomab pasudotox was assessed by using an in vitro luciferase translation assay. No inhibition of the luciferase mRNA
translation was observed for IEC pre-peak material, whereas the
moxetumomab pasudotox starting material inhibited the luciferase
mRNA translation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6). These results suggest that the IEC pre-peak material had dramatically
decreased activity to induce the ADP ribosylation of eEF2, as indicated by the changes on the catalyst domain of PE38, and therefore
caused the loss of cell-killing activity.
The correlation of IEC pre-peak levels with relative potency by
apoptosis bioassay were linearly plotted as described in a prior
study,30 but the ratio of the percent increase in deamidation to the
percent decrease in relative potency was not 1:1. A spiking study
was therefore carried out in which various ratios of puriﬁed IEC
pre-peak to main peak were tested for relative potency. The correlation between IEC pre-peak to potency was nonlinear (Fig. 7),
indicating that the IEC pre-peak material was not only inactive but
also appeared to competitively inhibit the biological activity of
moxetumomab pasudotox. The relationship between the IEC prepeak and relative potency can been expressed as

y ¼ að1  xÞ  ð1  bxÞ
where x is percent pre-peak, y is percent relative potency, a is the
relative potency of the pure main peak (percent pre-peak is 0), and
b is the factor of competitive inhibition. In this case, b is approximately 0.55. With an understanding of the correlation between
pre-peak and relative potency, an appropriate speciﬁcation can be
set for the pre-peak to ensure drug efﬁcacy and safety.
Interestingly, the Asn-358 deamidation level did not change
during the forced degradation study at high pH. The crystalline
structure of PE indicates that Asn-358 (Asn-495 in PE) is buried, so
Asn-358 deamidation can occur only during the refolding step,
when the molecule is exposed to high pH and denaturing conditions. The deamidated molecule folded incorrectly. With a clear
understanding of the structural impact of the deamidation, process
control can be achieved by optimizing the refolding conditions and
the puriﬁcation process to consistently produce high-quality
product.
Conclusions
In this study, we report a conformational change caused by a
single Asn deamidation based on DSC and HDX-MS data. Our results
provide an explanation for how Asn-358 deamidation impacted the
biological activity of moxetumomab pasudotox and why the deamidated variant eluted as an early peak in anion exchange chromatography. Importantly, our results indicate that residue Asn-358
is enveloped once the protein is folded and thus will not change
during storage conditions. With a clear understanding of the
structure-function relationship, the level of Asn-358 deamidation
variant can be minimized and controlled consistently in the current
process for producing clinical and commercial supplies.
