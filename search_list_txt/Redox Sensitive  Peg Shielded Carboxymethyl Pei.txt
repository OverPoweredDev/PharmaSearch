Introduction

Ovarian cancer is the 6th most common cancer in women
[1]. Major risk factors contributing to increase ovarian cancer
have been mentioned as hereditary, reproductive, hormonal,
inflammatory, dietary and surgical [2]. Indeed, it has been reported that hormone replacement therapy can be considered
as the major risk factor for developing ovarian cancer [3]. Regarding that only 30% of ovarian cancer patients at advanced
stages can survive only 5 years after initial diagnosis [4], so urgent needs for developing new therapeutic strategies seem to
be undeniable.
For almost 40 years, cisplatin (cis-Pt) has been the most accepted drug for treating ovarian cancer. It has been reported
that 80%−90% of patients with ovarian cancer respond to platinum chemotherapy, however nearly about one third of them
resist to cis-Pt [5]. Various mechanisms of cis-Pt resistance
have been studied which can be divided into pump (mediated by P-glycoprotein and multi-drug resistance proteins)
and non-pump mechanisms which are mainly due to antiapoptotic cellular defense activations mediated by Bcl-2 and
survivin [6,7]. Cis-Pt resistance can also occur by elevating
metallothioneins and glutathione content of the cells. In addition, increasing DNA repair can be considered as an antiappoptotic factor in cis-Pt resistant cells [8].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), non-coding endogenous evolutionarily conserved ∼18–22 nucleotide single-stranded RNAs, were
discovered in 1993 [9]. It has been clear that miRNAs have
major roles in gene expression regulation through base pair
formation with messenger RNAs [8]. miRNAs biogenesis and
their mechanisms of action have been well studied and it has
been demonstrated that any changes in intracellular amounts
of miRNA lead to severe diseases including autoimmune malfunctions [10], diabetes [11], Parkinson’s [12], fibrosis [13] and
cardiovascular [14] abnormalities and cancers such as breast,
glioblastoma, liver, ovary, prostate, lung, gastric, colon, and endocrine pancreatic tumors [15].
MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) has been considered as an oncogenic miRNA that upregulates in almost all diseases, downregulates tumor inhibitor proteins, leads to cell proliferation,
migration, invasion, metastasis, and apoptosis regulation [16].
Several studies demonstrate that miR-21 overexpression leads
to downregulation of critical tumor inhibitor proteins such
as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), programmed cell
death protein 4 (PDCD4), hypoxia inducible factor–1α (HIF-1α)
and regulates drug resistance in ovary cancer cells [17–21].
So, delivery of Anti-miR-21 to ovarian cancer cells seems to
be a promising way to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and
metastasis.
It has been reported that upregulation of miR-21 in ovarian cancer is responsible for cis-Pt resistance in cancer cells
by PDCD4 upregulation via JNK-1/c-Jun/miR-21 pathway [22].
The most important challenge to achieve convenient therapeutic approaches for miR/anti-miR therapy is lack of suitable delivery system which can overcome the obstacles of
systemic delivery such as phagocytic elimination, renal filtration, nucleases degradation, cellular uptake and endosomal release for possible translation to clinical practice

Main

PEIs have wide applications for gene delivery because of
their controlled polycationic nature which allow them to
condense negatively charged oligonucleotide chains, protect
them against nucleases and facilitate nucleic acid entering
efficiently via endocytosis [25,26]. Moreover, PEIs increase endosomal escape attributed to the well-known proton sponge
mechanism [27,28]. Chemical modifications of PEI primary
and secondary amines can enhance endosomal release of genetic materials by decreasing pKa that makes the modified
polymer more protonable at acidic than neutral pH [29,30]. In
addition, it has been shown that addition of carboxyl groups
induces proton sponge effect since ionized carboxylate groups
serve as proton-acceptors and enhanced buffer capacity of
nanovectors [31]. Also, the nanogels composed of PEG-PEI can
effectively deliver drug or oligonucleotide due to the positively
charged core of PEI and the shell of mPEG which leads to solubility enhancement, rapid endosomal uptake, prevention of
unwanted interactions of particles with plasma components
and nuclease protection [32–34]. In addition, these sterically
stabilized nanoscale particles can easily provide a convenient
environment for encapsulation of negatively charged biological agents such as miRNAs to promote their resistance against
changes in pH, ionic strength and solvent [33,35]. Simultaneously, biodegradable crosslinking provides the demanded stability of a relatively new generation of nanovectors, also called
nanogels, that causes protection of loaded oligonucleotide
chains. Furthermore, redox-sensitive disulfide linkages facilitate their breaking down and intracellular release of encapsulated contents in presence of glutathione and reducing enzymes of the cells, but prevent pre-mature release and degradation in the extracellular milieu [34–37].
In this regard, we aimed to synthesis a series of branched
PEI modifications including PEGylation reaction (PEG2k-PEI)
for steric shielding, redox-sensitive chemical crosslinking
(PEG2k-PEI-ss) for nanogel preparation and subsequent carboxymethylation reaction (PEG2k-CMPEI-ss) for modulation
of the polymer pka , respectively. To investigate the possible
role of disulfide crosslinks and the carboxymethylation reaction, the physicochemical and biological properties of the
nanogels were compared in terms of loading Anti-miR-21, formation of stable nanoplexes, cellular delivery and transfection
efficiency. In addition, the therapeutic value of Anti-miR-21
loaded PEG2k-PEI-ss nanogels was compared in A2780 sensitive (A2780S) and resistant (A2780R) cell lines to cis-Pt.

Polyethyleneimine 10 kDa (corresponding to Mw /Mn of 1.4)

were purchased from Poly Sciences Inc. (Canada) and Jenkem
(USA), respectively. Dithiodipropionic acid (DTDP), 1-(3dimethylamino-propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride

3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) were supplied from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).
ZnSO4 .7H2 O, dichloromethane (DCM), dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO), triethylamine (TEA), ethidium bromide (EtBr) and
potassium bromide (KBr) were obtained from Merck (Germany). A2780S and A2780R ovarian cancer cell lines were

lyophilized products with KBr and compression of the mixtures to form discs. Twenty scans were signal averaged with a
resolution of 4 cm−1 in range of 500–4000 cm−1 .


Coordination complex, micellar template-assisted synthesis
and characterization of PEG2k-PEI-ss was carried out according to the previous method by Abolmaali et al. [33,38]. Briefly,
a solution of NHS-activated mPEG2000 –COOH in methanol was
added to PEI solution in DCM at mPEG2000 /PEI weight ratios
at 0.5. The medium was supplemented by 1% TEA as a proton quencher and the tubes were incubated for 3 h while stirring. The product was concentrated using a rotational speed
vacuum (Christ RVC 2–18, Germany), diluted in 3 ml of deionized water, dialyzed using a Float-A-Lyzer 6–8 kDa (Spectrum,
USA) and lyophilized (Christ alpha 1–2 LD, Germany). For the
crosslinking reaction, 30 mg of PEG2k-PEI dissolved in 100 mM
MES buffer pH 5.6, ZnSO4 solution was added dropwise to
the polymer solution (Zn2+ /N ratio = 0.2) and stirred 30 min to
constitute a micellar template for the crosslinking reaction.
The crosslinking reaction was done by adding100 mM DTDP
solution in DMSO, EDC and NHS, at the molar ratio of 2:2:1
(NHS/EDC/COOH). The mixture was stirred overnight and then
the coordinated Zn2+ was removed by dialysis against HCl solution (pH 3.0) using Float-A-Lyzer 3.5 kDa.

2.3.

Carboxymethylation reaction

To carboxylate PEI primary and secondary amines buried in
the core of PEG2k-PEI-ss nanogels, a solution of 12 mg bromoacetic acid in 3 ml DMSO was added dropwise to 4 ml
nanogels (2.5 mg/ml). The product (PEG2k-CMPEI-ss) was then
stirred overnight at room temperature and then dialysis in
double distilled water for 3 d and stored in 4 °C before use.

NMR spectra was recorded on Bruker-400 MHz using D2 O
as solvent. Proton integration method was used to estimate
average degree of PEGylation, disulfide crosslinking and carboxymethylation.

Potentiometric titration

The potentiometric titration was performed to estimate the
degree of carboxymethylation. Briefly, aliquots of 20 μl of 1 M
NaOH solution were added to solutions of PEG2k-PEI, PEG2kPEI-ss and PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogels (equals to 1 mg PEI). Each
mixture was titrated with aliquots of 0.5 M HCl while shaking
at 25 °C. The titration curves were plotted and compared for
the nanogels.

2.4.5.

Ellman assay

To determine the redox-sensitivity of the nanogels, either simple or carboxylated, Ellman assay was performed [40]. Briefly,
25 μl of the reagent (0.2 M NaBH4 in 0.2% NaOH solution) were
mixed to 45 μl of samples containing 4 mM total amines and
incubated for 1 h. The volume reached to 90 μl with 300 mM
HEPES buffer (pH 8). Then, 10 μl of 4 mg/ml DTNB solution
(Ellman’s reagent) was added. After 15 min incubation, the
absorbance was read at 412 nm. The free thiol content was
calculated using a calibration curve plotted for reduced glutathione standard solutions.

Preparation and characterization of Anti-miR-21
loaded nanogels
2.5.1.

Gel retardation assay

Nanoplexes were prepared by simple mixing of Anti-miR-21
or scramble sequences with PEG2k-PEI copolymer, PEG2k-PEIss and PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogels at various N/P ratios ranging
from 0 to 10 in deionized water. The products were further incubated for 0.5, 3, 6 and 24 h at room temperature. Nanoplexes
were run in Bio-Rad electrophoresis apparatus at 60 V, 30 min
in 2.5% (w/v) agarose gel and visualized by UV transilluminator (Syngene gel documentation system) [41].

2.5.2.
To calculate the amount of residual primary amines in PEG2kPEI copolymer, PEG2k-PEI-ss and PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogels,
TNBS assay was performed according to the method described
by Freedman and Radda [39] at polymer concentrations equal
to 0.75 mM PEI. To 0.5 ml of each standard and sample solutions diluted in 0.1 M borate buffer (pH = 9.5), 2.6 μl TNBS
reagent was added. Following 45 min incubation at 25 °C, the
absorbance was read at λ = 420 nm using UV–visible spectrophotometer (ELISA reader, Biotek, USA).

Ethidium bromide (EtBr) dye exclusion assay

EtBr dye exclusion assay was performed to determine the optimum N/P ratio for loading and condensation of nucleic acid
sequences [42]. Nanoplexes were prepared according to the
aforementioned method in 96-well plates. After 30 min incubation at room temperature, 50 μl of 0.5 μg/ml of EtBr solution was added to each sample and mixed gently. The mixtures were incubated in dark condition for 15 min and the
fluorescence intensity was read at excitation and emission
λ = 510 nm and λ = 595 nm, respectively. Naked Anti-miR-21
sequence and deionized water were considered as positive
and negative controls, respectively.

FTIR spectroscopy

Infrared spectra were recorded on FTIR spectrometer (Vertex,
Bruker, Germany) to study spectral changes. Samples were
prepared by geometric dilution of an identical amount of the
Heparin sulfate competition assay

gel electrophoresis was performed. In this condition, the
nanoplexes were prepared at various N/P molar ratios and the
mixtures were incubated for 24 h at room temperature. Then,
2 μl of heparin sulfate (2 U/μg oligonucleotide) was added to
each sample, pipetted several times and after 15 min incubation, they were run in 2.5% agarose gel at 60 V for 30 min.
The bands were visualized using Syngene gel documentation
apparatus. In parallel, biological stability of the nanoplexes
was investigated by measuring their resistance against heparin sulfate by the EtBr dye exclusion assay. Briefly, 0.1–2 IU
heparin sulfate/μg oligonucleotide sequences were added to
each well of 96-well plate containing nanoplexes. After 15 min
incubation, 50 μl of 1 μg/ml EtBr was added to each well. Fluorescence intensities were determined before and after addition of heparin sulfate as mentioned before and any change
in nucleic acid condensation (%) were calculated accordingly.

2.5.4.

Stability of nanoplexes against DNaseI

To investigate the biological stability of nanoplexes against
nucleases, the nanoplexes at the N/P = 5 and also 3 μg of naked
Anti-miR-21 were mixed with 2 μl of reaction buffer and 2 U of
DNaseI, separately. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for
different times (0 min, 1, 3, 6 and 24 h). Aliquots at different
incubation times were run in 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and their stability against DNaseI was compared to naked
Anti-miR-21 [43].

Determination of particle size and ζ potential

Particle size was investigated by the dynamic light scattering
spectrometry (DLS 180°, Microtrac, Germany) using a patented
controlled reference method which incorporates 180° heterodyne detection by calculating signals of various scattered light
frequencies combined with the reflected signals of un-shifted
frequency of the original laser (780 nm) to generate a wide
spectrum of frequencies. The power spectrum of Doppler frequency shifts was then applied for the multimodal and broad
size distribution measurements. The hydrodynamic diameters of the nanogels and their respective nanoplexes with
Anti-miR-21 were determined in 20 mM phosphate buffer
(pH = 7) at the effective N/P molar ratio = 5. The viscosity and
refractive index of water at 25 °C were used for data analysis.
The intensity averaged diameters were reported for each sample. To calculate ζ potentials, the diluted samples underwent
Cell culture

Cellular studies were carried out using A2780S and A2780R
ovarian cancer lines. The cells were cultured in RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA, Australia) and 1% antibiotic (Penicillin–Streptomycin, Australia)
in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 . In order to preserve the
resistance phenotype, aliquots of 0.1 μM cis-Pt was added to
A2780 drug resistance cell line after each passage.

MTT cytotoxicity assay

A cell count of 2.5 × 104 A2780R and A2780S cells was seeded
in 96-well plates. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2 ,
the cells were treated with the culture medium containing

various concentrations of PEG2k-PEI copolymer, PEG2k-PEI-ss
and PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogels, at the concentrations ranged
between 0 and 100 μg/ml, to evaluate cytotoxicity of the
polymeric biomaterials. Furthermore, the MTT assay was
performed to investigate the sequence specific cytotoxicity associated with Anti-miR-21 vs. scrambled sequence
(100 ng/ml) loaded with the nanogels at different N/P mole
ratios (1, 3, 5) for 72 h. The medium was replaced with 100 μl
MTT (0.5 mg/ml) in PBS and incubated for a further 3 h. Finally,
the medium was aspirated and the remaining formazan crystals were solubilized in 100 μl/well DMSO. Light absorbance
was measured at 570 nm and corrected for the background
absorbance at 650 nm. Cell viability was calculated as percentage relative to untreated control cells [44].

Trypan blue membrane leakage assay

A2780R and A2780S cells were seeded (106 cells/well) in
6-well plates. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with solutions of the polymers alone, PEG2k-PEI, PEG2k-PEI-ss and
PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogels at the concentration of 32 mg/l,
or the loaded nanoplexes prepared at the constant N/P = 5
(3 μg/l Anti-miR-21 or the scrambled sequence). Next, the cells
were trypsinized and suspended in PBS containing trypan
blue and counted to determine the percentage of viable cells
(with clear cytoplasm) vs. non-viable cells (blue stained cytoplasm). Cell membrane leakage was expressed as the percentage of non-viable to total cells. Untreated cells served as
control [45].

2.6.3. Cellular uptake and intracellular release by fluorescence
microscopy
Cellular uptake of the FITC-labeled nanogels was determined
by fluorescence microscopy. First, to label the nanogels, 200 μl
of 10 mg/ml FITC was added to 4 ml of the nanogels (1.3 mg/ml)
in 0.1 M borate buffer (pH 9.2) and the mixture was incubated
for 2 h stirring. The excess FITC was removed by dialysis using
Float-A-Lyzer (8–10 kDa) at 4 °C in dark. The degree of conjugation was determined using standard curve plotted for FITC at
λ = 495 nm. Then, 105 cells (A2780R and A2780S) were seeded
in 6-well plates and treated for 0.5, 2 and 4 h with either
50 μg/ml FITC-labeled nanogels. Following treatment, the cells
were washed with cold PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 37 °C for 10 min. After washing with cold PBS,
the cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.5% in PBS)
for 10 min at 4 °C and washed with cold PBS. The nuclei were
stained with DAPI solution (10 μg/ml in PBS) for 5 min before
visualized by the fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse E400,
Japan).

miR-21 expression assay by stem-loop RT PCR

After 24 h incubation of the seeded cells in 6-well plates,
the cells were treated by nanoplexes with N/P = 5 molar ratios for 72 h. Then, the cells were scrapped and total RNA
was extracted according to Dena Zist Asia Kit procedure.
cDNA synthesis was done using M-MuLV-Reverse Transcriptase and special stem-loop primer for microRNA-21 (30 min
16 °C, 60 min 42 °C followed by 10 min 70 °C). Polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was done with the following pattern: 94 °C for
2 min, followed by 40–60 cycles of 93 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min


and 72 °C for 30 s. The products were run on 2.5% agarose gel
at 60 V for 30 min. Results were analyzed by ImageJ software.

2.7.
Interaction between miR-21 downregulation and
cis-Pt resistance
In order to evaluate the effect of treating cells with Anti-miR21 loaded nanoparticles on cis-Pt action, the sensitive and resistant cells were pre-treated with Anti-miR-21 nanoplexes
for 48 h. Following the treatment, the media were aspirated
and replaced by a medium containing 5 or 10 μM cis-Pt. After 24 h MTT assay was performed according to the aforementioned method.
In order to discriminate live, apoptotic and necrotic cells under fluorescent microscope, Acridine Orange (AO)/ Ethidium
Bromide (EtBr) double-staining assay was performed. 7 × 105
cells/well of A2780S and A2780R cells were seeded in 24-well
plates, treated with the nanoplexes (N/P = 5) for 72 h. Then,
the cells were trypsinized, stained with AO/EtBr dye mix in
PBS (100 μg/ml) and observed under fluorescent microscope
(Nikon Eclipse E400, Japan) [46].


Statistical analysis was performed using Prism Software
version 5.0 (GraphPad, USA). P values less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant. Data were expressed as
mean ± standard deviation.

Physicochemical characterization of the nanogels

In present study to investigate the effects of structural variation of PEG2k-PEI copolymer on transfection of Anti-miR21, synthesis of PEG2k-PEI-ss nanogels containing redoxsensitive crosslinks [33] and the carboxymethylated nanogels
(PEG2k-CMPEI-ss) have been done. Synthesis of PEG2k-PEI
copolymer and the PEG2k-PEI-ss nanogels were confirmed by
1 H NMR, FTIR and DLS methods as reported previously [33].
Following the carboxymethylation reaction, TNBS assay was
used in order to monitor changes in the concentration of primary amine residues [47,48], considering that the reactions
involves often the PEI primary amines [49]. Using the calibration curve plotted for standard glycine solutions, it was found
that about 14.7% of the PEG2k-PEI primary amines were consumed to produce simple nanogels and 87.0% of the remaining amines were used to produce PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogels,
so less than 10% of the available primary amines were only
present in chemical structure of the resulting nanogels, but
still sufficient for the fluorescent labeling of nanogels [50].
Following the carboxymethylation reaction, the chemical structure of nanogels were investigated by FTIR and 1 H
NMR spectroscopy. The peaks at 3420, 1113 and 1669 cm−1
is attributed to N–H, C–O and amide C=O stretching of PEI,
PEG2k and the crosslinker DTDP in the PEG2k-PEI-ss nanogels,
respectively. After carboxymethylation reaction, the unique

broad peak at 2500––3000 cm−1 appears that is related to
the hydroxyl group of carboxylic acid moieties (suplementary
data) as reported before [51]. The degree of carboxymethylation was determined by 1 H NMR. The peaks at 3.4 and 2.3–
3.3 ppm are related to CH2 –O of PEG and CH2 –N of PEI in
the spectrum of the PEG2k-PEI-ss nanogel. The specific peak
of CH2 –CH2 –COOH in the PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogel structure
is also located at 2.3–3.3 ppm, so the area under the curve
of this range increased (suplementary data). Degree of carboxymethylation was estimated about 44% for total primary
and secondary amines.
Potentiometric titration was performed to determine the
variation in buffer capacity of PEG2k-PEI copolymer following
synthesis of the nanogels at the concentration corresponding to 3.3 mg/ml PEI (Fig. 1). It was revealed that the titration
curves shifted to the right following the crosslinking reaction (PEG2k-PEI-ss). A further shift in acidic pH occurred after carboxymethylation reaction that is responsible not only
for increasing the buffering capacity and endosomal escape
properties, but also for reducing the cytotoxicity induced
by the positively charged nanoparticles [51]. The maximum
buffer capacity was determined in pH 5.3 corresponding to
pKa of the carboxylic acid groups that exist in the core of
PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogels [52].
Ellman’s assay method was done for determination of free
thiols recovered after treating the nanogels with a reducing
agent (NaBH4 ). Unlike untreated polymers, the free thiol concentrations were determined 0.14 ± 0.02 and 0.10 ± 0.01 mM
for PEG2k-PEI-ss and PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogels, respectively.
The concentrations of recovered free thiols were consistent
with estimated density of the crosslinks.

3.2.

Biological characterization of the nanoplexes

Gel retardation assay was carried out to investigate the
nanoplex formation after adding Anti-miR-21 to PEG2k-PEI,

PEG2k-PEI-ss or PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogels using agarose gel
electrophoresis [53]. Retardation of the oligonucleotide band
was noticed by increasing N/P ratios and the incubation time
until no residual naked oligonucleotide band was seen in
the gel as reported by others [54]. Depending on the chemical nature and structure of the polymers, the optimum N/P
molar ratio was different [55]. In our experiment, at low N/P
ratios of 0.5–1, the cationic charge was insufficient to neutralize and condense the negatively charged Anti-miR-21 even after long incubation times as reported elsewhere [54]. However,
upon increasing N/P ratios as well as the incubation time, the
migration of Anti-miR-21 was retarded in the gel so that no
migration happens in the gel for N/P as low as 5 and a
prolonged incubation time of 3–24 h, indicating a complete
neutralization of Anti-miR-21 negative charge through a complete nanoplex formation (Fig. 2). The nanoplexes formed
almost completely with PEG2k-PEI copolymer and PEG2kPEI-ss nanogels similarly at N/P ratio as low as 2, but the
required incubation times were different (3 h vs. 24 h for
the uncrosslinked copolymer and the nanogel, respectively)
(Fig. 2). The N/P ratio shifted to the higher value of 5 for PEG2kCMPEI-ss nanogels. A relatively prolonged incubation time is
required for Anti-miR-21 loading into the nanogels possibly
due to crosslinks in the polycation network that can hinder
DNA penetration for subsequent complex formation as reported by Hartlieb et al. [56].

Biologic stability of nanoplexes is a pre-requisite for successful transfection. It has been reported that biologic stability of nanoplexes is related to polymer structure and N/P
ratio [50]. So, the nanoplexes were exposed to heparin sulfate for determination of possible nucleic acid displacement
[57]. In this issue, the nanoplex structure can be disrupted
and Anti-miR-21 may be released following exposure to the
extracellular matrix due to the polyanionic nature of heparin sulfate [58]. As shown in Fig. 3, unlike the PEG2k-CMPEIss nanogels that resist against heparin sulfate-induced displacement of oligonucleotides at N/P ratio = 10, no displaced
oligonucleotide band was seen at N/P ratio as low as 5
similarly for the uncrosslinked PEG2k-PEI and PEG2k-PEI-ss
nanogels, indicating a complete protection against extracellular matrix. So, the results suggest that the crosslinking reaction provides convenient networks to capture Anti-miR-21
and lessen displacement induced by heparin sulfate. Although
there are generally more accessible cationic amines in the uncrosslinked polycation (PEG2k-PEI) than the nanogels (PEG2kPEI-ss and PEG2k-CMPEI-ss) to condense and neutralize negative charges of Anti-miR-21, the instability is less prominent
for PEG2k-PEI-ss nanogel possibly due to adequacy of the network structure to prevent heparin sulfate interaction.
EtBr dye exclusion assay was also carried out in order
to analysis of the nanoplex formation and the resistance
against heparin sulfate [59]. Intercalation of the EtBr with

oligonucleotides results in fluorescence intensity enhancement which decreases upon adding polycations as a result
of the fluorescent probe exclusion from their intercalation
sites [57,60,61]. The fluorescence intensity of intercalated EtBr
was determined at different N/P ratios. As shown in Fig. 4A,
by increasing the N/P ratios, the fluorescence intensity decreased, indicating oligonucleotide sequestration by the polycations. However, PEG2k-PEI-ss nanogel was the most efficient
polymer in capturing Anti-miR-21 oligonucleotide, the difference was more recognized at N/P = 2. For further characterization of the nanoplexes, polyanion (heparin sulfate) competition assay was performed. Fig. 4B shows that heparin sulfate triggered the release of Anti-miR-21 oligonucleotide from
the nanoplexes. PEG2k-PEI-ss nanogels show a better condensation of Anti-miR-21 than uncrosslinked PEG2k-PEI and
less efflux of the loaded Anti-miR-21 following heparin sulfate
treatment. It was believed that introduction of carboxylate
negative charge through carboxymethylation of the nanogels
(PEG2k-CMPEI-ss) may decrease competitive binding of the
nanogels to condense and protect Anti-miR-21. Therefore at a
sufficient nanogel concentration (N/P = 5), no practically significant efflux of the oligonucleotide was seen.

3.3.

Stability of nanoplexes against DNase I

DNase I digestion assay was done to evaluate Anti-miR-21 protection provided by the polycations against nucleases at N/P
of 5. Fig. 5 shows that although all polycations can protect the

oligonucleotide against enzymatic degradation, PEG2k-PEI-ss
and PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogels were more efficient than uncrosslinked PEG2k-PEI copolymer in protecting Anti-miR-21
after prolonged incubation times. This might be as the result
of slow penetration of high molecular weight nucleases into
the PEGylated nanogel network provided by crosslinking reactions [62].

Particle size and ζ potential

Colloidal properties (particle size and ζ potential) of the
nanogels and the resulting nanoplexes are among the factors
that determines stability, transfection activity and biocompatibility. Particle size and ζ potential values were determined before and after loading Anti-miR-21 at N/P = 5.
As presented in Table 1, ζ potentials of the nanogels are
inversely correlated with the protonable amine density. Although less aggregation may occur for the higher ζ zetapotentials due to greater electrostatic repulsion, no colloidal
instability was determined for PEG2k-CMPEI-ss. Moreover, the
particle sizes was determined less than those of PEG2k-PEIss possibly due to salt bridges between amines and carboxylate moieties resided within the nanogel structure. Following polyplex formations, reduction of the sizes and ζ potentials probably arises from the formation of tight complexes
with Anti-miR-21 [63] that were determined identical for the
uncrosslinked copolymer and the nanogels at N/P ratio of 5.
Although the mechanism by which oligonulcoetide interacts
with PEG2k-PEI may differ from the crosslinked structures, no


MTT assay

Cytotoxicity of polycations is almost a challengeable factor
for successful gene delivery [64]. To investigate first the cytocompatibility of nanogels, the cell viability was determined by
(a) MTT assay of the intracellular metabolic activity and (b) trypan blue exclusion assay that depends on the integrity of the
cellular membrane. Then, the sequence-specific cell growth
inhibition induced by the Anti-miR-21 loaded nanogels was
investigated as a function of N/P mole ratios (N/P = 1, 2 and
5) in A2780S and A2780R cell lines. As shown in Fig. 6A and
6B, neither PEG2k-PEI copolymer nor the nanogels showed any
significant cytotoxicity at concentrations as low as 10 μg/ml
(P < 0.05). However, their cytotoxicity increased by the poly-

mer concentration so that the cell viability decreased significantly at 50 and 100 μg/ml in both A2780S (P < 0.0001) and
A2780R (P < 0.01) cells. In addition, it was revealed that the
cytotoxicity of PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogels at the concentration of 100 μg/ml was significantly lower than PEG2k-PEI-ss
nanogels in A2780S and A2780R (P < 0.0001). The cytotoxicity
results can be explained according to primary amine contents
of the polycations [51,65] which cause interactions with negatively charged molecules located on the cell surface [64]. It has
been shown that crosslinking of PEG2k-PEI reduces cell toxicity significantly due to core-shell structure of the nanogels
that provides a better PEG shielding [33]. On the other hand,
carboxymethylation of the nanogels further improves the cell
compatibility which may be due to reduced pKa of PEG2k-PEI
and higher buffer capacity of PEG2k-CMPEI-ss in acidic pH as
demonstrated in Fig. 1. The lower pKa leads to reduced protonation of the nanogels and the lower positive ζ potentials at
physiologic pH (Table 1) that lessons the cell toxicity [51,66].
treatment than A2780S (P < 0.05). Treatment of A2780S cells
with PEG2k-PEI, PEG2k-PEI-ss and PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogels
loaded with Anti-miR-21 at N/P = 5 led to cell viability decrement (if compared to unloaded nanoparticles) by 4% (P < 0.05),
24% (P < 0.0001) and 35% (P < 0.0001), respectively; while the
decrements were determined more in A2780R cell lines, 11%
(P < 0.01), 28% (P < 0.0001) and 47% (P < 0.0001), respectively.
The nanogels loaded with the scrambled sequence did not
show any significant effect on the cell viability. Treating
A2780S cells with PEG2k-PEI, PEG2k-PEI-ss and PEG2k-CMPEIss nanogels loaded with Anti-miR-21 at N/P = 5 led to cell viability decrement while the decrements were determined more
in A2780R cell lines which can be explained by the abbarent
expression of miR-21 in A2780R compared to A2780S cell lines.

3.5.2.

Cell membrane leakage assay

Trypan blue membrane leakage assay was done in order to examine whether the nanogels either alone or after loading with
Anti-miR-21 at N/P = 5 brought about toxic effects on A2780
cell lines that led to the cell membrane leakage and the cell
death. Table 2 shows the cell viability changes when incubated with the nanogels for a prolonged period of 24 h. Unlike
the nanogel treatment alone that showed a modest toxicity,
the Anti-miR-21 nanoplexes prepared at the corresponding
nanogel concentration (N/P = 5) produced significant toxicity
(P < 0.05). The effect was more pronounced for PEG2k-CMPEIss nanogels similarly in A2780S and A2780R cells that may
be due to efficient delivery of Anti-miR-21 causing loss of cell
membrane integrity [67].

3.6.

Cellular uptake and intracellular release

Following nanoplex formation, the oligonucleotide charge
neutralization and condensation happens that can promote
oligonucleotide interaction with the negatively charged cell
membrane and cause cellular internalization especially at
high N/P ratios [68,69]. The cellular uptake of nanoplexes

77

is mainly energy dependent through different mechanisms
such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis [38]. After having incubated the cells for 1 h with FITC-labeled polycations, the fluorescence microscopy experiment was performed that shows
green fluorescence in cytoplasm due to cellular binding and
endosomal uptake in A2780 cell lines (Fig. 7A). The fluorescence was more intense in A2780R than A2780S cells. Cytoplasmic localization of the polycations was found after staining the nuclei by DAPI (blue color) to make the required
contrast. The green dotted pattern was noticed in the proximity of cell membranes for the polycations having co-treated
the cells with dextran-FITC. More uniform green fluorescence
was observed 4 h after treating the cells, indicating endosomal release into cytoplasm (Fig. 7B). The release was more
around the cell nuclei for PEG2k-CMPEI-ss in comparison to
PEG2k-PEI and PEG2k-PEI-ss nanogel. Carboxymethylation of
PEG2k-PEI nanogels lowers pka and increases buffer capacity
of the nanogels in more acidic pH of late endosomes (Fig. 1);
therefore, the endosomal escape can occur more effectively
far from the cell membrane and more close to the nucleus possibly through well-known proton sponge mechanism [27]. To
further investigate the endosomal release, co-localization experiment of the FITC labeled nanogel with Lysotracker is suggested.

3.7.

miR-21 expression

Cellular uptake and endosomal release of Anti-miR-21 can
result in miR-21 knockdown as reported elsewhere [70]. Relative expression levels of miR-21 after treating A2780S and
A2780R cell lines with Anti-miR-21 and the scrambled sequence, either naked or loaded in the nanogels, are shown in
Fig. 8A. The results clearly demonstrate that the loaded AntimiR-21 downregulated miR-21 expression whereas the loaded
scrambled sequence or the naked Anti-miR-21 did not show
any significant effects as reported elsewhere [71]. This result
indicates the gene knockdown is sequence-specific and needs
neutralization of the negative charge of Anti-miR-21 for a
successful transfection [71]. The efficiency of gene silencing
was absolutely more remarkable in A2780R than A2780R cells.
Moreover, the downregulation of miR-21 was more evident
in the cell lines treated with Anti-miR-21 loaded in PEG2kCMPEI-ss nanogels. No changes in ß-actin expression (the
housekeeping gene as shown in Fig. 8B) was detected. As reported in literature, the positive charges enhance cells interactions, cellular uptake and endosomal release [70] that might
result in miR-21 knockdown. On the other hand, enhanced
endosomal release as presented in Fig. 7B might have significant effects in cytoplasmic release of Anti-miR-21 and consequently microRNA-21 down-regulation.

3.8.

Effect of miR-21 downregulation on cis-Pt resistance

It has been revealed that miR-21 overexpression is directly related to drug resistance [17,20,72–75]. cis-Pt treatment alone did not exert any significant cytotoxicity either in A2780S or A2780R in the concentrations below 20 μM
(Fig. 9A). As shown in Fig. 9B, treating cells with cis-Pt after 48 h incubation with Anti-miR-21 loaded nanogels sensitized cells remarkably to cis-Pt, even in its low concentrations

(5 and 10 μM). This observation can be explained by the research finding that down-regulation of miR-21 could sensitize
A2780R to cis-Pt through down-regulation of PTEN expression
and JNK-1/c-Jun/miR-21 pathway [18]. Indeed, it has been revealed that A2780R is more sensitive in response to Anti-miR21 treatment than A2780S at N/P = 5 that may be due to the
aberrant miR-21 expression in A2780R compared to A2780S
(Fig. 9B) [18].

Live / dead assay

As demonstrated in Fig. 10, live cells with normal morphology can be observed in the untreated control or the
scrambled sequence loaded nanogels. On the other hand,
early and late apoptotic cells were recognized in the cells
treated with Anti-miR-21 loaded PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogels
(42% ± 6.4% and 56% ± 1.6% of live cells in A2780R and A2780S,
respectively). Thus, cellular DNA damage mediated by apoptosis and secondary necrosis, was remarkably induced after Anti-miR-21 loaded PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogels treatment
(Fig. 10), probably because of enhanced endosomal release of
Anti-miR-21 as presented in Fig. 7B, which can potentiate the
expression of tumor suppressor PDCD4 and revoked apoptosis
inhibitor c-IAP2 [22].

Conclusion
Various PEI modifications including PEG2k-PEI copolymer,
PEG2k-PEI-ss and PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogels have been prepared to improve transfection of Anti-miR-21. Although the vs. untreated control cells. Green live cells showed normal morphology; yellowish-green early apoptotic cells showed
nuclear margination and chromatin condensation, while late orange apoptotic cells showed fragmented chromatin and
apoptotic bodies. cross-linking and carboxymethylation reactions decrease primary amine contents of the PEG2k-PEI needed for oligonucleotide charge neutralization and condensation, protonation
of primary amines at physiologic pH and the general cytotoxicity are diminished. Moreover, the nanogels can effectively
protect Anti-miR-21 against extracellular matrix and also
DNase digestion. Notably, an enhanced endosomal escape
and transfection efficiency are determined for the nanogels.
Therefore, PEG2k-CMPEI-ss nanogels is proposed as a potential nano-vector for Anti-miR-21 delivery and a basis for future
dual delivery with chemotherapeutic agents. Investigation of
cellular trafficking of the nanogels, the biologic consequences
of miR-21 down-regulation and molecular mechanisms of cisPt chemosensitization by the nanoplexes are suggested for
further study.
