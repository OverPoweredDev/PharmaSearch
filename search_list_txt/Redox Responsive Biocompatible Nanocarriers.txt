better biocompatibility and less toxicity side effect. The cytotoxicity of DOX/KSV against
MGC80-3 cells was significantly greater than that of free DOX and DOX/KV. Furthermore,
compared with DOX/KV in MGC80-3 cells, DOX/KSV micelles uptook more anticancer drugs
and then released DOX faster into the cell nucleus. The micelles were endocytosed by multiple pathways, but clathrin-mediated endocytosis was the main pathway. Therefore, heparosan polysaccharide could be a potential option as anticancer carrier for enhancing efficacy and mitigating toxicity.

Introduction

Cancer is a global public health problem. In the current treatment of cancer, chemotherapy is one of the most important
methods [1]. Doxorubicin (DOX), an antibiotic anticancer drug,
is used for multiple cancers such as bladder cancer, breast
cancer, stomach cancer, ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, lung
cancer, multiple myeloma and soft tissue sarcoma [2–4]. However, the poor targeting and serious side effects limit the application of DOX [5–7]. In order to solve these problems, in
the past several decades, drug delivery systems (DDS) have
been developed for the delivery of DOX, such as liposomes,
nanoparticles, and polymer micelles [8–10]. Among them,
polymer micelles which are easy to prepare and applicable
to all hydrophobic drugs have attracted attention due to their
unique advantages. Polymer micelles are usually composed of
hydrophobic core in which hydrophobic drugs can be loaded
and hydrophilic shell which can keep the core away from
the aqueous environment [11]. What’s more, the structure
can greatly increase the solubility and stability of hydrophobic drugs in aqueous solution, resulting in enhancing their
bioavailability and blood circulation time. And the hydrophilic
shell can protect the carrier from reticulo-endothelial system
(RES) [12–18]. Polymer micelles also can improve the selectivity of tumor tissue through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects to significantly increase the efficiency of anticancer drugs [6,19].
The materials for constructing polymer micelle can be divided into natural polymers and synthetic polymers according
to their sources. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a commonly used
synthetic material. PEGylated polymer micelles are widely
used because of their prone to self-assembly, small particle
size, narrow size distribution and unique shell and shell structure [20,21]. However, as the synthetic material, PEG has poor
biodegradability and biocompatibility. PEG is metabolized to
some accumulated toxic metabolites in vivo. Besides, studies have found that PEG shell can hinder the disassembly of
the micelles and reduce drug release from tumor cells [22,23].
Natural materials have gradually become hotspot polymers to
study due to their high biocompatibility and biodegradability. The natural polymer materials are represented by polysaccharides such as chitosan [24], hyaluronic acid [25] and heparin [26]. However, most of polysaccharides can be degraded
by enzyme resulting in short circulation time of nanoparticles in vivo. Therefore, how to design a better delivery system becomes an important issue. Heparosan (HR) is a natural precursor to heparin biosynthesis in mammals and a
heparin-like material. But unlike heparin, HR will not be degraded by heparanase in vivo because of the unsulfated oxygen
site, which endows HR with long circulation effect. However,
HR can be degraded by glucuronidase and hexosaminidase to
N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid in lysosomes. The
degradation products are normal monosaccharides in vivo and
can be recycled by cells without accumulation in the tissue
[27]. Therefore, HR has good biocompatibility and HR-based
drug delivery systems are considered “zero-residue” system
[28].
After arrival at tumor cell, anticancer drugs encapsulated
into the polymer micelles need to be released in time to

achieve their high therapeutic efficiency for tumors [29,30].
Some studies also have shown that faster intracellular drug
release can improve cytotoxicity and overcome MDR [31].
In recent years, environmental stimuli-responsive polymer
micelles have been widely used for delivery and controlled
release of anticancer drugs. Stimuli-responsive polymer micelles can be triggered by pH, temperature, enzymes, redox potentials, light, magnetic fields and ultrasound waves
[32–38] to rapidly release the loaded drugs. Among them,
redox-sensitive polymer micelles have been widely studied
because of the difference redox content between extracellular and tumor cells [39–41]. It is noteworthy that many tumor
cells have higher glutathione (GSH) concentrations than normal cells [42]. This difference can cause rapid release of active
ingredients such as drugs, genes, and proteins from the redoxsensitive carriers resulting in a stronger therapeutic effect
[43–45].
In this study, high-purity HR polysaccharide obtained by a
combination of modern separation and chromatography techniques was used to prepare the redox-sensitive amphiphilic
copolymer. Vitamin E succinate was linked to polysaccharide
by cystatines (CYS) to synthesize heparosan-cystamine- vitamin E succinate (KSV) copolymers. And redox-insensitive
heparosan-adipic acid dihydrazide-vitamin E succinate (KV)
copolymers were synthesized as controls. Using DOX as a
model anticancer drug, the properties of blank micelles and
drug-loaded micelles were investigated. The cytotoxicity and
intracellular release of the micelles against MGC80-3 cells and
COS7 cells were evaluated. Furthermore, the internalization
pathways of DOX-loaded micelles were further tested. The
preparation and antitumor effect of DOX-loaded micelles is
shown in Scheme 1.

Cell culture

Human gastric cancer cells (MGC80-3) and transformed
African green monkey SV40-transformed kidney fibroblast
cells (COS7) were purchased from Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and grown in DMEM (Gibco, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 mg/ml
streptomycin sulfate, 100 U/ml penicillin G sodium. Cells were
incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%
CO2 .

2.3.

Synthesis of redox-sensitive KSV copolymers

Cystamine-vitamin E succinate was prepared firstly. Cystamine dihydrochloride was pretreated by NaOH solution
through acid-base neutralization [46]. Vitamin E succinate
(1.5 × 10−4 mol) was dissolved in DMF at room temperature
and EDC (3 × 10−4 mol) and NHS (3 × 10−4 mol) were added to
the solution successively to activate carboxylic groups. Cystamine (1.5 × 10−4 mol, 1:1; 7.5 × 10−4 mol, 5:1) dissolved in
DMF (5 ml) and was dropped into the vitamin E succinate solution, stirring for 48 h under a nitrogen atmosphere at room
temperature. After completion, the solution was dialyzed in
the dialysis bag (MWCO 3500) against distilled water for 2 d,
and then freeze-dried to obtain cystamine-vitamin E succinate.
Then heparosan (1.5 × 10−4 mol) was dissolved in formamide. After activation of the carboxyl groups, heparosan was dropped into the cystamine-vitamin E succinate
(1.5 × 10−4 mol) solution and then stirred for 48 h under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. After the reaction
finished, the mixture was allowed to dialyze in the dialysis

membrane (MWCO 3500) against 25% ethanol solution and
pure water, and then freeze-dried to obtain KSV copolymers.

2.4.

Synthesis of redox-insensitive KV copolymers

As controls, the insensitive KV copolymers were also synthesized by two steps. Firstly, adipic acid dihydrazide
(7.25 × 10−4 mol) and EDC (2.5 × 10−4 mol) were added into the
heparosan (1.25 × 10−4 mol) solution. The pH of mixture solution was adjusted to 4.75 by 0.1 M HCl and stirred for 1 h. Then
the reaction was ended by the addition of 0.1 M NaOH. The solution was dialyzed (MWCO 3500) in distilled water for 2 d, and
freeze-dried to obtain Heparosan-ADH.
Secondly, VES (1.5 × 10−4 mol) was dissolved in a mixed solution of dimethylformamide and formamide and activated by
EDC and NHS. Heparosan-ADH (1.5 × 10−4 mol) was dropped
into the VES solution and stirred for 48 h under a nitrogen
atmosphere at room temperature. The reaction solution was
allowed to dialyze in the dialysis membrane (MWCO 3500)
against 0.1 M sodium chloride, 25% ethanol solution, and pure
water, and finally freeze-dried to obtain KV copolymers.

2.5.

Preparation of DOX-loaded micelles

DOX•HCl (10 mg, 0.017 mmol) was dissolved in methanol
(10 ml). After adding triethylamine (1 ml), the solution was
stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The organic solvent
was removed by rotary evaporation, and then tetrahydrofuran was added to obtain DOX base form solution. KSV copolymer (10 mg) was dissolved in PBS (pH 7.4, 10 ml). After sufficient dispersion, the DOX base form solution (2 ml) was
slowly dropped into the solution and the mixture solution was

86

stirred overnight in dark. DOX-loaded KSV polymer micelles
(DOX/KSV) were got after ultrasonic 30 min in an ice bath. Similarly, DOX-loaded KV polymer micelles (DOX/KV) were also
prepared with the similar method.

2.6.

2.7.
Serum stability and redox-triggered disassembly of
micelles
The serum stability and redox-sensitive test of the polymer
micelles were measured by dynamic light scattering spectrophotometry (Zetasizer Nano ZS apparatus, MalvernInstruments, UK), as described by Choi et al. with some modification
[48]. Briefly, the micelles were dissolved in pH 7.4 PBS solution mixed with DMEM solution containing 10% FBS, and the
changes of size were measured at different times. In order
to verify the reduction-sensitive of KSV copolymers, the micelles were dispersed in GSH-containing PBS solution (10 mM,
pH 7.4) and tested at programmed times.

Determination of drug-loading efficiency

In order to detect the contained drugs, free DOX was separated
by ultrafiltration firstly. Dimethyl sulfoxide was added into the
micelles to destroy the micellar structure. According to this
method, encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading content (DL) were tested by an UV spectrophotometer (UV-2550,
Shimadzu, Japan) with wavelength of 480 nm.
Characterization of the micelles

The average particle size, distribution and zeta potential of
the micelles were investigated by Zetasizer Nano ZS apparatus (MalvernInstruments, UK) at 37 °C. The morphology of
DOX/KSV and DOX/KV micelles were observed by JEM-2100
TEM with acceleration voltage was 80 kV (JEO, Japan). Typically,
the micelles were dropped onto the copper grid and the solution was evaporated. Then it was negatively stained with 2%
phosphotungstic acid before observation.
The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of KSV and KV
copolymers was determined by fluorescence spectrophotometer (RF-5301 PC, Shimadzu, Japan) with pyrene as a hydrophobic probe [47]. Briefly, after pyrene solution completely
evaporated under a nitrogen stream, a series of polymer solutions with a concentration of 1.0 × 10−4 to 2.0 mg/ml were
added to the tubes to obtain a final pyrene concentration
of 6.0 × 10−7 M. The excitation spectrum of pyrene was determined by fluorescence spectrophotometer, and CMC value
was calculated according to the change of the excitation spectrum.

In vitro reduction-triggered release behaviors

The release of DOX from the both micelles in vitro was tested
using dialysis method. The drug-loaded micelles were placed
into the dialysis bags (MWCO 1000) which were immersed in
20 ml of different medium at 37 °C, 100 r/min conditions. At a
predetermined time point, the medium was sampled to cal-

Where, Er represents the cumulative release of DOX, mDOX is
the content of the drug in the micelles, V0 represents the total
volume of the release medium, Ve is the replacement volume
of the release medium and Ci represents the drug concentration released at the ith sample.

2.10.

In vitro cytotoxicity assays

The in vitro cytotoxicity of blank micelles and drug-loaded
micelles was determined by MTT assay using cancer cells
(MGC80-3) and normal cells (COS7). Briefly, COS7 and MGC803 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 .
After incubated for 24 h, the prepared blank micelles with a
concentration range of 0–500 μg/ml and drug-loaded micelles
with a concentration range of 0–10 μg/ml (DOX/KV, DOX/KSV)
were added to replace the old medium. Then, 100 μl MTT solution was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. MTT solution was discarded and DMSO (100 μl) was added to dissolve
blue-violet crystals. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured
by using Multiskan MK3 microplate reader (Thermo, USA) to
calculate the cell viability. The IC50 values were calculated using SPSS 17.0 (Chicago, IL, USA).

2.11. Observation of the cellular uptake of DOX-loaded
micelles
The intracellular distribution of free DOX, DOX/KSV and
DOX/KV micelles in MGC80-3 and COS7 cells were observed by
confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM, Nikon A1R, Japan).
MGC80-3 and COS7 cells were seeded into a laser confocal
dish at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well. Free DOX or drugloaded micelles (DOX conc entration of 5.0 μg/ml) were added
and after 1 h, 2 h and 4 h of incubation, the cells were fixed
by 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Then, DAPI fluorescent dye
(20 μg/ml, 30 min) was used to make the nucleus visible. The
remaining DAPI fluorescent dye was thoroughly washed with
PBS, and 300 μl of PBS was added to each well for observation
by CLSM.

2.12.

Flow cytometry analysis

The cellular uptakes of free DOX, DOX/KSV and DOX/KV micelles in MGC80-3 and COS7 cells were measured by flow cytometry (FCM) (BD FACSCalibur). The cells were plated in 6well plates at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well. After Incubated at
37 °C and 5% CO2 for 12 h, the medium was replaced with free
DOX or drug-loaded micelles (DOX concentration of 5.0 μg/ml).
After incubated for different times, the cells were dispersed
into PBS and measured by FCM.

Study of the cellular uptake mechanism

2.13.1. Effects of ATP depletion and low temperature on cellular
uptake
FCM was used to investigate whether the cellular uptake of
micelles was energy-dependent. Firstly, MGC80-3 cells were
seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 3.0 × 105 cells/well.

After incubation of 30 min at 4 °C, drug-loaded micelles (DOX
concentration of 5.0 μg/ml) were added into the cells for further 1 h incubation. Then the cells were dispersed with 500 μl
PBS and measured by FCM. In the control group, the treatment
methods were the same except that the incubated environment was placed to 37 °C, and the uptake of the control group
was set to 100%.

The cytotoxicity of each inhibitor to MGC80-3 cells at the
experimental concentration was determined by MTT assay
firstly. MGC80-3 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well for incubation of 24 h. And then uptake inhibitors were added with the experimental concentration: quercetin (10 μg/ml) [49], chlorpromazine (10 μg/ml)
[50], colchicine (40 μg/ml) [51] and indomethacin (10 μg/ml)
[52] were co-incubated with MGC80-3 cells for 2 h.
Then, the uptake pathway of drug-loaded micelles was
studied by FCM. MGC80-3 cells were seeded into 6-well plates
at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well. The inhibitors were added

to replace the old medium, and drug-loaded micelles (DOX
concentration of 5 μg/ml) were incubated for 1 h and measured by flow cytometry. Cells treated with no inhibitor were
used as controls and the fluorescence intensity was set to
100%.

Statistical analysis

The results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation

Results and discussion

3.1.
KSV

Synthesis of redox-sensitive amphiphilic copolymer

The 1 H NMR spectrum of KSV is shown in Fig. 1. The carboxyl groups in heparosan polysaccharide and VES were conjugated to the -NH2 groups of CYS, respectively. The typical peaks of glucosamine on heparosan polysaccharide were
shown at 3.63 ppm, 3.83 ppm, and 5.31 ppm and the typical
peak of glucosamine methylation on heparosan polysaccharide (-CO–CH3 ) was shown at 1.98 ppm. The typical peaks
of glucuronic acid on heparosan polysaccharide were shown
at 3.29 ppm, 3.72 ppm, and 4.54 ppm. The typical peaks of
methylene (-CH2 -) on the alkanes of VES were shown at 1.05–
1.35 ppm and 2.85 ppm, and methyl group (-CH3 ) on the phenyl
ring was shown at 2.63 ppm. The typical peaks of the amide
group (-CONH-) were shown between 8.05 and 8.11 ppm. Based
on these results, it can be confirmed that the amphiphilic
copolymer KSV has been successfully synthesized.

2.63 ppm is the typical peak of VES (-CH3 ), and 5.31 ppm is
the typical peak of the heparosan polysaccharide. The ratio
of the integral area between the peaks was used to calculate
the substitution degree of VES. Two kinds of KSV copolymers
with different substitution ratios were synthesized. The substitution degrees were respectively 17% and 21%, which were
expressed by KSV17 and KSV21 .

3.2.

Characterization of the micelles

The blank micelles and drug-loaded micelles were prepared
by the ultrasonic method and their physicochemical properties were characterized. The results are shown in Table 1.
With the increase of the substitution degree, the particle size
of both micelles decreased slightly because of the compact
hydrophobic core probably. However, particle sizes of the micelles were shown all below 200 nm and presented a narrow
size distribution (Fig. 2A), indicating that the micelles can be
easily targeted to tumor tissue by EPR effect. The zeta potential
of the micelles was kept at a negative value, which could prevent the micelles from aggregation by electrostatic repulsion.

Fig. 6 – CLSM images of (A) COS7 cells and (B) MGC80-3 cells after incubation different times with DOX, DOX/KV and
DOX/KSV. DOX was visualized as the red fluorescence, nucleuses labeled with Hoechst 33,342 were shown as the blue
fluorescence and the merged showed purple. DOX concentration was 5 μg/ml. Scale bars correspond to 10 μm in all the
images. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
article.)

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 2B) was shown
that DOX/KSV had a nearly spherical morphology and good
dispersibility.
As shown in Table 1, the drug loading and entrapment efficiency of the micelles were 13%−15% and 88%−90%, which
means all micelles can load drug well. As the degree of substitution increased, the affinity between the hydrophobic core
and the drug increased, so the drug loading and entrapment
efficiency of DOX/KSV21 were slightly greater. Furthermore,
the copolymers had small CMC values, which indicate that the
micelles have better thermodynamic stability [53] and can exist stably in vivo.

3.3.

Serum stability and redox-sensitive of KSV

Studies have shown that nanoparticle with high polymer content may cause blood coagulation or gelation in vivo [54], so it is
necessary to investigate the stability of nanoparticle in serum
(FBS) at 37 °C. The average size of the protein in FBS was 10 nm,
which did not affect the measurement of the micelle particle
size. As shown in Fig. 3A, after incubation of 48 h in FBS, no
precipitates and visible particles were found, and there was
no significant increase in the micellar particle size. The result
indicates that only a small amount of serum proteins were adsorbed on the micelles and the micelles will not aggregate into
larger particles by absorbing serum proteins after intravenous
injection. Therefore, the copolymer micelles are relatively stable in serum probably due to the generation of a hydrophilic
shell.
The disulfide bond in KSV structure makes it have the characteristic of redox-sensitive. In order to determine the redoxsensitive of micelles, the particle size of KSV micelles incubated with PBS solution (10 mM GSH, pH7.4) was measured by

dynamic light scattering (DLS) method (Fig. 3B). It can be seen
that the micelles had a good particle size at the beginning.
However, the particle size was gradually increased with time
extension, indicating the micelles could be disassembled and
had obvious redox-sensitive property.

3.4.

In vitro redox-sensitive drug release studies

In order to study in vitro release behavior of DOX/KSV and
DOX/KV, pH 7.4 PBS, pH 5.0 PBS and GSH-containing PBS
(10 mM, pH 5.0) were used to simulate the normal physiologic
environment, tumor acid environment, and tumor intracellular redox-environment. As shown in Fig. 4A, the cumulative release of DOX from both of DOX/KSV micelles in GSH
(10 mM, pH 5.0 PBS) were 82.33% and 77.34%, respectively. This
indicates that the anticancer drug can be effectively released
from the micelles in the tumor cell environment. It is worth
noting that the cumulative release of DOX/KSV17 is slightly
higher than that of DOX/KSV21 (P < 0.05). This may be due to
the fact that DOX/KSV17 was disassembled faster in the reducing condition.
In addition, further experiments were designed to investigate the effect of GSH on DOX/KSV and DOX/KV micelles. As
shown in Fig. 4B, the release amount of DOX/KSV and DOX/KV
in pH 5.0 was higher than that at pH 7.4 (P < 0.01). This difference was probably due to the better solubility of DOX at low
pH. However, when GSH was added at 6 h, a sudden release of
DOX/KSV was observed while there was no significant change
in the DOX/KV release. This also indicates that the micellar
structure of DOX/KSV was disassembled in the presence of
GSH resulting in the fast release of the drug. The above results indicate that DOX/KSV has stable in normal physiological condition but the drug can be released rapidly after arrival

at tumor cells resulting in enhancing the efficacy of anticancer
drugs.

3.5.

In vitro cytotoxicity assay

The MTT assay was used to assess the biocompatibility
of the blank micelles. The cell viability of MGC80-3 cells
(Fig. 5A) and COS7 (Fig. 5B) cells were exceeded 90% even at
high concentrations (500 μg/ml), suggesting the blank micelles
were virtually non-toxic. The cytotoxicity of DOX/KSV and
DOX/KV against MGC80-3 cells and COS7 cells is also studied (Fig. 5). As the concentration of DOX increased, both cell
viabilities gradually decreased, indicating that the cytotoxicity is concentration-dependent for drug-loaded micelles. For
COS7 cells, the median inhibitory concentrations (IC50 ) of free
DOX, DOX/KSV17 , DOX/KSV21 and DOX/KV were 1.752 ± 0.134,

4.931 ± 0.1622, 5.386 ± 0.209 and 4.717 ± 0.211 μg/ml respectively. There was a significant difference between free DOX
and micelles (P < 0.001), but the cytotoxicity of all the micelle groups was similar. Because the level of GSH was low
in normal cells, the release rate of DOX from DOX/KSV was
slow resulting in no significant difference in the IC50 values of DOX/KSV and DOX/KV micelles. However, in MGC803 cells, the IC50 value of DOX/KSV (1.003 ± 0.067 μg/ml) was
significantly lower than that of DOX/KV(4.717 ± 0.211 μg/ml).
This could be attributed to the rapid release of DOX from
DOX/KSV resulting from the high concentration of GSH in
tumor cells. It was worth noting that the IC50 value of
DOX/KSV micelles against MGC80-3 cells was about 5-fold
higher than that of COS7 cells (P < 0.001), indicating that
redox-sensitive micelles have better selectivity for tumor
cells.

Cellular uptake study

CLSM was used to qualitatively investigate the in vitro cellular uptake of DOX/KSV and DOX/KV in MGC80-3 cells and
COS7 cells. After co-incubated with free DOX, DOX/KSV17 ,
DOX/KSV21 and DOX/KV micelles, MGC80-3 cells and COS7
cells were observed by CLSM. As shown in Fig. 6, DOX was
mainly concentrated in the cytoplasm after incubation for
1 h, but more drugs were entered into the nucleus in free
DOX group. For all groups, the fluorescence intensity of DOX
increased after co-incubated for 2 h and 4 h. It was worth
noting that most of DOX in the micelle groups remained
in the cytoplasm after co-incubation for 4 h in COS7 cells
(Fig. 6A), which indicated that the drugs were not released
quickly from the micelles. However, in MGC80-3 cells (Fig. 6B),
DOX was released gradually from the drug-loaded micelles
into the nucleus after co-incubated for 2 h. And it was not
difficult to see that DOX/KSV disassembled faster and had
stronger fluorescence signal than DOX/KV, which also was
caused by the redox-sensitive behavior of micelles.
FCM was used to further quantitatively test the cellular uptake of DOX/KSV and DOX/KV in tumor and normal cells. In
COS7 cells, there was no significant difference in the mean
fluorescence intensities of DOX/KSV and DOX/ KV (Fig. 7A and
B). However, the cellular uptake of redox-sensitive micelles
was significantly higher than that of redox-insensitive micelles (P < 0.001) in MGC80-3 cells (Fig. 7C and 7D). The results
indicate that redox-sensitive DOX/KSV micelles can be more
uptaken by tumor cells.

3.7.

Study of the endocytosis pathways

In order to determine the potential endocytic pathway of micelles, a series of uptake inhibitors were used. Specifically,
chlorpromazine is an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, indomethacin is an inhibitor of caveolae-mediated

endocytosis, colchicine is an inhibitor of macropinocytosis, and quercetin is an inhibitor of clathrin/caveolaeindependent endocytosis. Fig. 8A clearly shows the cytotoxicity of each inhibitor to MGC80-3 cells, which indicates that
the inhibitor had no toxicity with cell viability above 90% at
the experimental concentration. Therefore, cellular uptake inhibition was not caused by inhibitor toxicity. Then the uptake
of micelles in MGC80-3 cells after treatment with different inhibitors is shown in Fig. 8B. Compared to the control, a significant reduction was observed at low temperatures and the uptake rates of DOX/KV and DOX/KSV decreased to 36.89% and
39.59% (P < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 8), which indicates that the
uptake pathway of the micelles is an energy-dependent pathway. In addition, the uptake of DOX/KV and DOX/KSV micelles
decreased to 59.07% (P < 0.001) and 58.37% (P < 0.001), respectively in presence of chlorpromazine. And after DOX/KV and
DOX/KSV treated with colchicine and indomethacin, the uptake was decreased to 84.46%, 87.04% (P < 0.05) and 87.24%,
88.41%, (P < 0.05) respectively. However, there was no significant change after treatment with quercetin. These results indicate that though clathrin- and caveolae-mediated
endocytosis both affect cellular uptake of the heparosanbased micelle, clathrin-mediated endocytosis plays a major
role.

Conclusion

In this study, the redox-sensitive heparosan-based amphiphilic copolymers were designed and they self-assembled
into micelles in aqueous solution. The DOX/KSV micelles
could remain stable under plasma and physiological conditions but dissociate and release DOX in the tumor microenvironment. So DOX/KSV had reduction sensitivity and could
be internalized in tumor cells to release more anticancer
drugs rapidly. The cytotoxicity of drug-loaded micelles in tumor cells was significantly higher than that of normal cells,

Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 15 (2020) 83–94

and the redox-sensitive micelles DOX/KSV had more toxicity than redox-insensitive micelles DOX/KV in MGC80-3 cells.
Moreover, drug-loaded micelles could enter cancer cells more
efficiently compared with normal cells, and DOX/KSV disassembled rapidly in tumor cells to release DOX. In addition, a
low degree of KSV micelles showed a better antitumor activity.
The micelles were uptaken into tumor cells via multiple pathways and primarily through clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
Therefore, redox-sensitive DOX/KSV micelles can effectively
deliver antitumor drugs to tumors while reducing side effects
on normal tissues and heparosan-based polymers have great
potential as effective drug carriers.
