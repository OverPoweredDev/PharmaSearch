Abstract
The outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has developed into an unprecedented global pandemic. Clinical investigations in patients with COVID-19 has shown a strong upregulation of cytokine and interferon production in SARSCoV2- induced pneumonia, with an associated cytokine storm syndrome. Thus, the identification of existing
approved therapies with proven safety profiles to treat hyperinflammation is a critical unmet need in order to
reduce COVI-19 associated mortality. To date, no specific therapeutic drugs or vaccines are available to treat
COVID-19 patients. This review evaluates several options that have been proposed to control SARS-CoV2 hyperinflammation and cytokine storm, eincluding antiviral drugs, vaccines, small-molecules, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotides, peptides, and interferons (IFNs).

Main

1. Covid-19 pathogenesis
COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus, is a potentially fatal
disease that represents a major global public health concern. The SARSCoV2 virus infects the lower respiratory tract and causes pneumonia in
humans, with symptoms that appear milder than SARS or MERS infection, but ultimately becomes a lethal disease of hyperinflammation
and respiratory dysfunction [1]. bySARS-CoV2 infection and disease
can be approximately divided into three phases: I. an asymptomatic
phase with or without detectable virus; II. a non-severe symptomatic
phase with upper airway involvement; and III. a severe, potentially
lethal disease with hypoxia, 'ground glass' infiltrates in the lung, and
progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high
viral load (Fig. 1) [2].
The coronavirus genome encodes four major proteins: spike (S),
nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E). The S protein is
responsible for viral entry into target ACEII expressing cells of the body.
Approximately 75 percent of the SARS-CoV2 genome is identical to the
SARS-CoV genome, and the amino acid residues required for receptor
binding are the same between these two viruses; both viruses use the
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor to infect airway
epithelial cells and endothelial cells. [3].
ARDS is the main cause of death in COVID-19 disease, and appears
to cause similar immunopathogenic features in SARS-CoV and MERSCoV infections [4]. One of the main features of ARDS is the cytokine
storm - an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from
the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by immune
effector cells [5]. High blood levels of cytokines and chemokines have
been detected in patients with COVID-19 infection, including: IL1-β,
IL1RA, IL7, IL8, IL9, IL10, basic FGF2, GCSF, GMCSF, IFNγ, IP10,
MCP1, MIP1α, MIP1β, PDGFB, TNFα, and VEGFA [6]. The ensuing
cytokine storm triggers a violent inflammatory immune response that
contributes to ARDS, multiple organ failure, and finally death in severe
cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
infections [5]. Patients infected with COVID-19 showed higher leukocyte numbers, abnormal respiratory findings, and increased levels ofplasma pro-inflammatory cytokines [4] (Fig. 2) [7]. The direct cause of
death from acute COVID-19 involves cytokine storm damage to lungs
and multiple organs of the body: heart, kidney and liver, leading to
multiple organexhaustion [8,9,11,12].
2. Interferons as a potential therapy for COVID-19
New therapeutic interventions will likely require a long lead time
for the development of approved drugs. Thus, in light of the dire need
and urgency to identify the treatment and control of COVID-2019, a
repurposing of IFNs and other approved drugs is a potential option in
drug development for the control of coronavirus infection. The potential drug options for SARS-CoV-2 infection include the use of enzyme
inhibitors, nucleosides, host-targeted agents, convalescent plasma and
IFNs [13,14]. Interferons (IFN) enhance the immune system in several
ways, by exhibiting various biological functions including antiviral,
antiproliferative, immunomodulatory and developmental activities
[15] (Fig. 3). IFNs employed therapeutically are manufactured using
recombinant DNA technology and multiple clinically approved IFNs are
available: IFN α-2a (Roferon), IFN α-2b (Intron A), IFN α-n1 (Wellferon), IFN α-n3 (Alferon), IFN α -con 1 (Infergen), IFN β-1a (Rebif),
IFN β-1b (Betaferon), IFN β -1a (Avonex), IFN β -1b (Betaseron), IFN α
-2a (Pegasys), IFN α -2b (PegIntron), IFN α P-2b (Sylatron), and IFN γ1b (Acimmune) [18,19].
In a recent study with MERS-CoV infected patients, the combination
of Remdesivir and IFNbeta revealed superior antiviral activity, compared to the effect of lopinavir and ritonavir [20]. Treatment of these
patients with oral ribavirin and subcutaneous pegylated IFN alpha-2a
demonstrated significant improvement in survival, provided that adequate monitoring and assessment was available [21,22]. Remdesivir
and IFN beta may likewise prove useful in the treatment of COVID-19
[14–16], particularly since recent clinical trials have demonstrated that
Remdesivir shortened the length of time in hospital intensive care for
Covid-19 patients.
Earlier studies showed that coronaviruses including MERS, SARS,
human coronavirus 229E, and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)

were susceptible to IFN treatment [17,23]. In patients with MERS infection, a combination of ritonavir plus IFN α2a or IFN α-2b resulted in
significantly improved survival after 14 days of treatment. The combination of ritonavir and IFNβhad no significant effect on clinical outcome in patients infected with MERS, but the combination of ribavirin
(1), ritonavir (2) and IFN α-2a inhibited viremia within 48h of treatment [13]. The use of recombinant IFNs (IFN -α, IFN -β and exogenous
IFNs) in the treatment of SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV demonstrated that IFN response inhibited protein synthesis and replication of the virus [24–26]. IFN α and γ, alone or in combination, showed
partial efficacy against the animal coronaviruses, as well as inhibiting
SARS-CoV replication in vitro. IFN β had the highest potency,

demonstrating prophylactic protection and antiviral potential post infection [27]. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to test the safety and
efficacy of human and recombinant IFNs in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, alone or in combination with other antiviral drugs.
3. Potential combination approaches for COVID-19
At present, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with
COVID-19, with the exception of the recently studied Remdesivir. It was
shown that Remdesivir reduced the patients' time in ICU from fifteen
days to eleven days. Originally developed as a small molecule
