abstract

Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been widely introduced to treat hepatocellular

carcinoma (HCC) especially for unresectable patients for decades. However, TACE evokes

an angiogenic response due to the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),


resulting in the formation of new blood vessels and eventually tumor recurrence. Thus, we

aimed to develop regorafenib (REGO)-loaded poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres
that enabled localized and sustained drug delivery to limit proangiogenic responses

Introduction
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) are broadly used
against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) especially for
inoperable patients for decades [1,2]. Conventional TACE
usually involves intra-arterial administration of contrast
medium and chemotherapeutic drugs via a catheter under
image guidance, followed by embolization of the tumorfeeding artery with embolic agents (e.g., gelatin sponge,
degradable starch microspheres). For TACE with drugeluting beads (DEB-TACE), chemotherapeutic drugs were
encapsulated into the embolic microspheres prior to their
transarterial delivery, which could execute dual-missions of
occluding the selected vessels and controlling drug release.
The embolic microspheres are usually classified into the
non-biodegradable and biodegradable, which could both be
applied for TACE [3,4].

Main
The strategy of TACE can deliver high doses of
chemotherapeutic drugs to tumors and also induce local
ischemia and hypoxia via arterial embolization, which
result in tumor necrosis and shrinkage. However, this
ischemic or hypoxic variation of HCC after TACE induces
the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
up-regulation and proangiogenic responses, leading to
neoangiogenesis and eventually tumor recurrence [5–7].
Thus, TACE in combination with anti-angiogenic agents
can decrease post-TACE angiogenesis and improve TACE
therapy for HCC in theory. There have been a number of
clinical trials conducted in this area. Most of them are
combined regimens of oral antiangiogenic agents and
TACE. These clinical trials results are inconclusive, some
of them proved to be safe and promising [8–10]; while,
the others were controversial and needed further research
[11–13]. Compared to oral antiangiogenic agents, local delivery
of microspheres loaded antiangiogenic agents together with
TACE might offer a promising therapeutic regimen for
HCC, with potentially enhanced therapeutic efficacy of
TACE meanwhile reduced systemic exposures through drug
entrapment in tumor-feeding vessels.
As an oral multikinase inhibitor, regorafenib (REGO)
provides antiangiogenic activity in various tumor types
by the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor
receptors (VEGFR), tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin
and epidermal growth factor homology domain 2 (TIE2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β),
and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). The activity
is correlated with suppression of cell proliferation, and
induction of apoptosis by the inhibition of oncogenic
kinases (KIT, RET, RAF-1, BRAF and mutant BRAF) [13,14].
It was approved for treating gastrointestinal stromal or
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) [15,16]. In 2017, FDA approved

REGO for a second-line therapy in previously sorafenib
treated HCC patients [17]. Some commercial products
of non-biodegradable microspheres have come into the
R
market already such as DC Beads
and HepasphereTM for
TACE. Drugs especially the positively charged were usually
shielded by ion exchange approach, and the drug elution
kinetics were determined by the ionic environment of
physiological fluids [4,18]. Compared with non-biodegradable
microspheres, the biodegradable might expand the types of
drug loading with adjustable drug release kinetics [19,20].
REGO is a hydrophobic drug that cannot be shielded into
R
aforementioned microspheres (DC Bead
, HepasphereTM ).
In order to formulate REGO for TACE, we developed
new biodegradable drug loading microspheres. These
microspheres could better fine tune the flexible loading
and release of the drug. As a biodegradable polymer approved
by FDA, Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) has been widely
applied in the preparation of various drug delivery platforms
such as microspheres, implants, and in situ forming depots
due to its biocompatibility and tunable properties [21,22]. The
potential of PLGA microspheres prepared for TACE have been
reported in several studies [23–25].
We aimed to develop REGO-loaded PLGA microspheres
for improvement of TACE therapeutic effects, which can
sustainably deliver REGO to limit proangiogenic responses in
liver tumors after TACE. PLGA microspheres were prepared
via the emulsion-solvent evaporation method with a
cosolvent system. Physicochemical characterization of
microspheres and the in vitro drug release were further
investigated. Subsequently, the type and proportion of
cosolvent were optimized. In order to confirm the role of
REGO-loaded microspheres tailored to combine controlled
local delivery and TACE, we introduced injectable miriplatin
as chemotherapeutic drug used in TACE. Miriplatin is a highly
lipophilic platinum derivative that can be delivered and
suspended in Lipiodol for TACE in HCC treatment [26,27]. The
in vitro biological activity in groups of blank microspheres,
REGO microspheres, miriplatin, and REGO microspheres plus
miriplatin has been further assessed for cytotoxicity and
anti-angiogenic efficacy. In vivo pharmacokinetics of REGO
microspheres and miriplatin were preliminarily evaluated in
healthy adult New Zealand white male rabbits. The in vivo
antitumor effects have also been investigated in HepG2 tumor
models.

was purchased from Evonik Industries (Essen, Germany).

Procell Life Science Co. Ltd., (Wuhan, China). Miriplatinresistant human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells (HepG2/MIRI)
were established from their parental HepG2 cells by using
pulse treatment with high concentration of miriplatin
combining treatment with miriplatin of low concentration
gradually increased and maintained in the presence of

Research Laboratories (Carlsbad, CA, USA) were maintained in
ECM medium containing 5% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) ECGS. All
cells were incubated at standard cell culture condition (37 °C
with 5% CO2 ).

Shanghai Lingchang Biotechnology Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China).
Adult New Zealand white male rabbits (2.0 ± 0.2 kg) were
purchased from Nanjing Qinglongshan Animal breeding Co.
Ltd (Nanjing, China). Animals were housed with a natural
light–dark cycle, and acclimatized for 1 week prior to
study. The rabbits were fasted 12 h before the study. The
animal studies were approved by the China Pharmaceutical
University Animal Ethics Committee.

2.4.

Determination of REGO solubility

REGO solubility in dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate
(EA), acetone (AC), and dimethylformamide (DMF) were
determined by incubating excess REGO in 1 ml of each
solvent at 25 °C in a constant temperature air bath shaker
at 100 rpm (rpm) for 24 h. REGO and solvent mixture
were centrifuged for 10 min at the speed of 12 000 rpm to
separate supernatant, then the supernatant were filtered
using syringe filters (ClarinertTM , Nylon, 0.22 μm). The filtered
supernatant was diluted with the separated solvents and
analyzed by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC)
using Waters ACQUITY H-Class (Milford, USA). Briefly, 1 μl of
the supernatant was injected onto a Waters BEH C18 column
(100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) with the column temperature of
35 °C.The mobile phase was acetonitrile-water (70:30, v/v) at
the flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and the detection wavelength was
265 nm.

2.5.

Preparation of REGO microspheres

The controlled release microspheres of REGO were prepared
by oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion-solvent evaporation method.
PLGA (350 mg) and a specific amount of REGO (12–150 mg) were
used in each of the formulation. PLGA and REGO were both
dissolved in pre-designated 5 ml organic solvents (Table 1)
followed by mixing using a vortex mixer. The solution was
emulsified in 300 ml 1% PVA solution in a 1000 ml beaker by
stirring at 500 rpm for 3 min with a magnetic stir bar. The
stirring step was maintained at 200 rpm for 16 h to reach
complete solvent evaporation. After 10 min and 1500 rpm
centrifugation, the samples were further processed by
vacuum filtration, washed with deionized water four times,
and desiccated by freeze-lyophilized (overnight) to obtain the
microspheres.
Moreover, REGO microspheres were prepared by varying
the ratios of DMF and DCM. Briefly, PLGA (350 mg) and a
specific amount of REGO (150 mg) were dissolved with the 5 ml
mixture of DMF-DCM (Table 2). The preparation method of
microspheres is the same as the method described above. The
blank microspheres were prepared using the same method,
except that REGO was not added.

2.6.

Characterization of blank and REGO microspheres

Samples of REGO, blank microspheres, physical mixture
of REGO with blank microspheres and REGO-loaded
microspheres were analyzed via Infrared (IR) spectra
(NICOLET iS10; Thermo Fisher, Massachusetts, USA). The
samples were scanned in the range from 400 to 4000 cm−1 .

Additionally, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) technique
was applied to analyzing above four groups by X-ray
diffractometer (SmartLab3; Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan). The
samples were measured with the diffraction angle from
5° to 80°, 2θ angle.

2.7.

Morphology and particle size

The surface morphology and shape of the microspheres
was investigated through scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) (Hitachi S-3700 N; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Microsphere
samples were mounted on the double-sided conductive
adhesive attached to the sample plate and sputter-coated
with gold. Particle size was measured with laser scattering
device (Mastersizer 2000; Malvern instruments, Malvern,
UK). The respective samples were suspended in water and
subsequently, wet measurements of the microspheres size
were performed. Particle size expressed as volume weighted
mean diameter.

as HepG2/MIRI-REGO 0, HepG2/MIRI-REGO 0.5, HepG2/MIRIREGO 1.0 and HepG2/MIRI-REGO 2.0.
The resistant cell lines above-mentioned and HepG-2 cells
with a density of 5 × 103 cells/well were inoculated into 96well microplates. After treatment with miriplatin as designed,
the IC50 of each cell line was determined by MTT method.
After adding 20 μl MTT solution (5 mg/ml) to each well, and
the plate was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The supernatants were
removed and DMSO were added to dissolve the formazan
product. Cell viability was analyzed by microplate reader
(Power Wave TM XS; BIOTEX, northern Vermont, USA) at
570 nm. Cell viability (%) was calculated as (OD of test
group/OD of control group) × 100%. To study the effect of
REGO on drug resistance of HepG-2 induced by miriplatin,
the IC50 values of miriplatin towards the resistant cell lines
and HepG-2 cells were determined. The resistance index was
calculated as the IC50 of the resistant cell lines divided by the
IC50 of HepG-2 cells.

In vitro cytotoxicity studies

Drug loading evaluation

For drug loading assessment, 2 ml of DCM was added to 25 mg
REGO microspheres, accurately weighed in 50 ml screw-cap
tube, and soaked in a field of ultrasonic waves for 15 min
with occasional shaking. Mobile phase (acetonitrile/water,
70:30, v/v) was added to dilute to volume followed by
filtration using syringe filters (ClarinertTM , Nylon, 0.22 μm).
The amount of REGO encapsulated was evaluated by the UPLC
method as described above. The drug loading capacity (LC)
was calculated as loaded amount of REGO divided by the
total microspheres weight. The loading efficiency (LE) was
calculated as the loaded REGO divided by the total REGO
amount feeding for encapsulation.

In vitro release studies

The automatic dissolution tester (SOTAX AT 7smart On-Line
System; Sotax, Basel, Switzerland) were applied to evaluating
controlled release behavior of REGO microspheres. It was
studied using the paddle method with stirring speed at
100 rpm. The dissolution medium used was 800 ml pH 7.4
phosphate buffer containing 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate,
maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5 °C. Approximately 10 mg of REGO
microspheres were immersed in the dissolution medium, at
predetermined time intervals (1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 1 d, 2 d, 4 d, 6
d, 8 d, 10 d, 12 d, 16 d, 20 d, 25 d and 30 d), 5 ml samples were
withdrawn and 5 ml fresh media was added. After filtering
through syringe filters (ClarinertTM , MCM, 0.22 μm), the REGO
concentration in the filtrate were determined by the UPLC
method as described above.

2.10. Effect of REGO on drug-resistance of HepG-2 induced
by miriplatin
In the process of establishing drug-resistant cells HepG2/MIRI,
HepG-2 cells were divided into four groups and induced by
miriplatin in the presence of REGO at concentrations (0,
0.5, 1.0, 2.0 μmol/l) showing no or low cytotoxicity on the
HepG-2 cells. The resistant cell lines are named accordingly

In vitro cytotoxicity of groups of blank microspheres, REGO
microspheres, miriplatin, and REGO microspheres plus
miriplatin against HepG2 cells were assessed by MTT assay.
The four groups of samples were incubated in cell culture
medium for 1 d, 3 d and 7 d at 37 °C, respectively, after which
supernatants were collected. The HepG2 cells with a density
of 5 × 103 cells/well were inoculated into 96-well microplates
and treated with the supernatants for 48 h. The cytotoxicity
of cells to samples was measured as previously described
MTT method.

2.12.

In vitro HUVECs tube-formation assay

The effect of released REGO on angiogenesis was evaluated by
HUVECs Tube-formation Assay. After thawed on ice for 24 h,
diluted matrigel was added into 96-well plates 50 μl per well
then placed plates on ice bags for 10 min, cultured for 1 h at
37 °C to allow solidify. 2 × 104 HUVECs in ECM supplemented
with 2% (v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) ECGS (50 μl/well) were seeded into
96-well plates, an equal volume of supernatant (supernatant
from microspheres of 7 d identical as for section “2.11”)
or bevacizumab (VEGF inhibitor, positive control) were also
added into 96-well plates. After 10 h incubation, five areas
were randomly selected for each group to photograph with an
inverted microscope (DMi 8; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) at 100times magnification. The numbers of endothelial tubes in five
different regions were analyzed with ImageJ software (Version
1.48v) and Angiogenesis Analyzer plug-in for ImageJ and
its average value was applied to calculate tubule formation
rate.

microspheres (50 mg/kg) with 2 ml Iodized oil were infused,
and then the catheter was withdrawn. At predetermined time
intervals (1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 1 d, 2 d, 4 d, 6 d, 8 d, 10 d, 12 d, 16
d, 20 d, 25 d and 30 d), 0.5 ml blood samples were collected
from rabbit auricular vein. All the blood samples were
centrifuged to extract the plasma and stored at −80 °C until
analysis.
REGO concentrations were measured by LC/MS (ACQUITY
UPLC-Xevo TQ-S; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). 50 μl acetonitrile
containing 135 ng/ml sorafenib (internal standard) was
pipetted into a polypropylene tube that contained 100 μl of
plasma, and 850 μl of acetonitrile were added. After 3 min
vortexing followed by 5 min centrifugation at 12 000 rpm, the
supernatant was analyzed by using UPLC/MS system on a
Waters BEH C18 column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) with the
column temperature of 35 °C. The isocratic mobile phases
consisted of 0.02% (v/v) formic acid in water–methanol (22:78,
v/v) at the flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The chromatographic run
time was 6 min.
Miriplatin concentrations were measured by platinum
(Pt) analysis using ICP-MS (X series 2; Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) in standard instrument operation mode.
The commentated tune solution was used to optimize the
instrument parameter. The major isotope of platinum (Pt)
was determined at m/z of 195, meanwhile, internal standard
element indium (In) was determined at m/z 115. An aliquot
of 0.2 ml rabbit plasma was added into a perfluoralkoxy (PFA)
vessel (25 ml), adding 1.5 ml of HNO3 (65%) and 0.5 ml of
HCl (37%). Then the microwave-assisted acid digestion was
performed using a microwave (MARS 6, CEM, Matthews, NC,
USA). Prior to ICP-MS analysis, the sample solutions were
diluted to 10 ml with deionized water. The pharmacokinetic
parameters were calculated from the average REGO and
miriplatin (Pt) concentrations in the bloodstream using
Kinetic 4.4.1.

In vivo evaluation in a HepG2 xenograft tumor model

A HepG2 xenograft tumor model was established in female
BALB/c nude mice, which was applied to determine the in vivo
anti-tumor activity of REGO microspheres and/or miriplatin.
Female BALB/c mice (4–5 weeks old) were implanted at
the right armpit by subcutaneous injection with HepG2
tumor cells (3 × 106 /0.2 ml PBS). When tumor size was
approx. 150–200 mm3 , 24 BALB/c mice were randomized
into 4 groups of 6 animals each. Subsequently, animals in
four groups were treated with blank microspheres (control,
200 mg/kg), REGO microspheres (200 mg/kg), miriplatin alone
(25 mg/kg) and REGO microspheres (200 mg/kg) plus miriplatin
(25 mg/kg), respectively. In four groups, mice were treated by
intratumorally injection with samples suspended in 100 μl
Iodized oil, which were used immediately after preparation.
Animal weights were recorded during the experiments. Tumor
length (L), width (W) were measured and tumor volume (TV)
was calculated as TV=1/2 × L × W2 . After 17 d of observation,
animals were sacrificed, and then the tumor tissues were
excised and weighed. Tumor growth inhibition was defined
as the ratio of mean tumor volume of treated group
compared with control group at the time of sacrifice of the
mice.

Results and discussion

3.1.

Determination of REGO solubility in organic solvents

R
Clinically, non-biodegradable microspheres (e.g. DC Beads
TM
and Hepasphere ) have been widely used in TACE for
HCC treatment. However, since poor water solubility,
REGO cannot be readily loaded into the microspheres
by ion exchange. To deliver the hydrophobic drug, REGO
microspheres were developed via the oil in water (O/W)
emulsion-solvent evaporation, a commonly used method
for microencapsulating of hydrophobic drugs. Herein, PLGA
was introduced for microsphere fabrication, firstly which
dissolved along with drug in the organic phase. Thus, it is
essential to determine REGO solubility in various solvents (e.g.
DCM, EA, AC and DMF) potentially applicable for microsphere
preparation. We measured REGO solubility of these solvents,
and found that the values of REGO solubility was 2.71 ± 0.06,
15.16 ± 0.17, 32.63 ± 0.26, and 410.34 ± 2.65 mg/ml in DCM,
EA, AC and DMF at 25 °C, respectively. According to the
description of solubility in the United States Pharmacopoeia
(USP), REGO is only slightly soluble in DCM (one of the
most desirable solvents in O/W emulsion method), sparingly
soluble in EA and AC, but freely soluble in DMF. Due to low
solubility of REGO in DCM, EA and AC, and undesirable for
microsphere preparation (water-miscible DMF), single solvent
is not suitable for preparing REGO/PLGA microspheres.
Alternatively, a cosolvent system may be added to DCM for
preparation of REGO/PLGA microspheres; and as reported,
solvents of EA, AC and DMF have been proposed as cosolvent
[28–30].

3.2.
Preparation of REGO microspheres using various
organic solvents
As described above, single solvent is not appropriate for
fabricating the microspheres. For example, the LC of
REGO/PLGA microspheres prepared using DCM alone was
only 2.1%. For the development of REGO microspheres with
high loading efficiency, we tested EA, AC and DMF as cosolvent
with DCM. As results shown in Table 1, when EC, AC and DMF
were used as cosolvent with DCM, the LC of microspheres
increased to 3.7%, 7.3% and 28.6%, respectively.
The LE of the microspheres prepared by EA and AC
as cosolvent of DCM was 57.5% and 48.4%, respectively,
which was significantly lower than that of the microspheres
prepared by DCM single solvent (83.6%). In comparison, LE
for that of the microspheres obtained from DMF as cosolvent
with DCM was 91.5%. As the capacity for dissolution of
polymer and drug, the characteristics including interfacial
tension of solvent, solubility of solvent in water and viscosity,

need to be further considered (Appendix) [51–53], since they
usually affect the LE and particle size of the microspheres.
In this study, the insolubility in water and higher solubility
in organic phase of REGO were beneficial to improving LE
of microspheres. We also found that the high interfacial
tension of organic solvent is desirable in terms of improving
the LE of microspheres; meanwhile, with the increase of
the interfacial tension, the particle size of microspheres
increased correspondingly, similar to previous reports [31,32].
In addition, the solubility of solvent in water may also
influence LE of microspheres [33]. Last but not the least,
the LE difference of microspheres obtained from AC and
DMF might be due to not only the balance between the two
factors mentioned above, but also the viscosity of the polymer
solution. The higher viscosity (0.802 cP) of DMF compared to
that (0.316 cP) of AC might also contribute to the enhancement
of LE in microspheres.
The optimal microspheres formulation should possess
reasonably high LC and LE. For instance, multiple hydrophobic
drug-loaded polymeric microspheres have been reported for
TACE treatment with cisplatin LC of 2.4% for poly (D,L-lactic
acid) microspheres in DCM [20], sorafenib LC of 15.7% for poly
(D,L-lactic acid) microspheres in dimethyl sulphoxide plus
DCM [20], and sorafenib LC of 18.6% for PLGA microspheres
in dimethyl sulphoxide plus DCM [24]. In contrast to the
previous studies, the obtained REGO microspheres could
achieve high LC (28.6%) and LE (91.5%) by using the desired
DMF-DCM cosolvent system. It was a common opinion that
microspheres with diameters ranging from 40 to 1000 μm
would be desirable [34]. The average particle size of 149 μm
for the prepared microspheres was suitable for TACE. From
the results described above, it is observed that DMF as
cosolvent with DCM gave appropriate characterizations of LC,
LE and particle size in microsphere formulation. It is worth to
mention that PLGA microspheres via using cosolvent system

could also be applied as platforms to deliver poorly water
soluble, potent but costly drugs (e.g., sorafenib, cisplatin and
paclitaxel).

REGO microspheres preparation in various ratios of
DMF-DCM
3.3.1. REGO microspheres preparation in various ratios of
DMF-DCM
Collectively, the preparation of REGO microspheres via using
DMF-DCM is the optimal cosolvent system. The difficulty
still remained whether the ratios of DMF and DCM would
affect the performance of REGO microspheres including LC,
LE, particle size, surface morphology and release profiles in
vitro. Accordingly, the ratios of DMF and DCM were selected
at 1:9, 1:4 or 3:7 to prepare REGO microspheres, and the
effects of ratios of DMF and DCM on microspheres were
further examined. As shown in Table 2, the particle size of
microspheres was 149, 170 and 200 μm, respectively, increased
with the augment of the DMF proportion. As discussed above,
the augment of DMF proportion might increase interfacial
tension of mixed solvents, accordingly cause the increase
of particle size of the microspheres. The LC and LE of the
microspheres were 27.9%−29.6% and 87.1%−91.5%, without
significant differences while changing the proportion of DMF.

3.3.2. Morphology of REGO microspheres in various ratios of
DMF-DCM
By the observation of SEM, surface morphology of REGO
microspheres in various ratios of DMF-DCM were shown in
Fig. 1. With the increase of DMF proportion, there were more
and more pits on the surface of microspheres. Meanwhile, the
drug particles also increased accordingly on the surface of
microspheres. It was speculated that during the microsphere
preparation, DMF partitions into the aqueous phase resulted

to the poor aqueous solubility of REGO.

3.3.3. In vitro release of REGO microspheres in various ratios
of DMF-DCM
The solubility of regorafenib in dissolution medium at 37 °C
was 26.28 μg/ml, which was measured reference to the
method described in Section 2.4. The release profiles of REGO
from the microspheres were illustrated in Fig. 2. Even though
the microspheres of different formulations gave similar LC, it
appears that they displayed different release profiles in vitro.
Overall, all formulations exhibited biphasic release pattern
during 30-d period: first phase was an initial burst release;
secondary phase was a more sustained release. In the first
2 d release intervals, the microspheres prepared in ratios
of 1:9, 1:4, 3:7 for DMF and DCM initially released about
23.1%, 25.2% and 26.1%, respectively. The initial burst release
could be due to the drug diffused from the particles on the
surface of microspheres. And in our case, REGO microspheres
surface may contain high amount of drug particles due to
higher drug-loading, which might promote the occurrence
of burst release [35]. Recent studies have demonstrated that
patient serum/plasma VEGF levels increased significantly
within the first 24 h after TACE, suggesting an undesirable
neoangiogenetic reaction [36,37]. As we developed REGOloaded PLGA microspheres to limit proangiogenic responses
for TACE, the initial burst of REGO might be beneficial for
clinical application to synchronize with and act on the first
24 h rising of VEGF levels. At 30 d, the release percentage of
REGO from the microspheres prepared in ratios of 1:9, 1:4, 3:7
for DMF and DCM were 70.8%, 57.6% and 51.2%, respectively.
The 30-day release decreased with the increase of DMF ratio,
and the lower release of REGO might be explained by the
increase of particle size of the microspheres. The different
release behaviors of the obtained microspheres were affected
by their physicochemical properties such as morphology,
particle size and drug loading. Like process parameters,
multiple competing factors such as solubility of drug in the
organic phase, interfacial tension between solvent (cosolvent)
and water, the viscosity of the polymer phase, and solubility
of solvent in water could also affect the aforementioned

physicochemical properties. This certainly increased the
complexity of drug release, meanwhile provided numerous
possible ways to fulfill the adjustable release [38,39]. The
drug release profile would indeed offer more treatment
options for TACE therapy. Collectively, the microspheres
provided a platform to better adjust the loading of the
drug(s), particle size and the release pattern, which could
meet the requirements of various drug delivery systems.
The dissolution pattern of the formulation in ratios of 1:9
for DMF and DCM was optimal for the desired (highest)
30-d sustained release in our study. In the subsequent
experiments, we chose the microspheres prepared in ratios of
1:9 for DMF and DCM for further investigation.

3.4.
Characterization of blank microspheres and REGO
microspheres
The morphology of REGO microspheres from SEM has
confirmed the successful formation of REGO microspheres.
For further verification, we utilized Infrared spectra and X-ray
powder diffraction to characterize the prepared microspheres.
As shown in Fig. 3 of IR spectra, REGO shared characteristic
absorption peaks at 1123, 1540, 1716 and 3375 cm−1 . These
absorption peaks still existed in the physical mixture of
blank microspheres with REGO except for the intensity
decreased. As REGO microspheres, these absorption peaks
almost disappeared.
As XRD profiles shown in Fig. 4, REGO gave crystal
diffraction peaks in the range of 10°−35°, indicating that
REGO existed in the form of crystal. Similar to IR spectra,
these characteristic peaks still presented in the physical
mixture of blank microspheres and REGO; however, the
intensity decreased simultaneously. It was observed that the
characteristic peaks for REGO in XRD pattern could not be
found in REGO microspheres. The results of IR and XRD images
suggested that REGO were embedded in the skeleton of PLGA
microspheres and did not exist in a mixed form.

3.5.
Effect of REGO on drug resistance of HepG-2 induced
by miriplatin
In our study, we introduced injectable miriplatin as
chemotherapeutic drug for TACE. Considering that the
cytotoxic chemotherapeutics are susceptible to drug
resistance in the treatment of HCC, we introduced
REGO for the remedy. In previous studies, REGO could
antagonistic the resistance of paclitaxel associated with
ABCB1 transporter on colorectal tumors in mice [40]. We
determined the cytotoxicity of miriplatin on HepG-2 cells
and the resistant cell lines, and the effect of REGO on
the resistant cell lines induced by miriplatin was further
evaluated. The IC50 values of miriplatin and the resistance
index of resistant cell lines were summarized in Table 3.
HepG2/MIRI-REGO 0 cell displayed resistance to miriplatin
with IC50 of (30.08 ± 0.27) μg/ml, as well as the resistance
index of 13.61 as compared to HepG-2 cells. Upon REGO
action in the process of establishing drug-resistant cells,
the sensitivity of the drug resistant cell HepG2/MIRIREGO 0.5, HepG2/MIRI-REGO 1.0, HepG2/MIRI-REGO 2.0
to miriplatin was enhanced, and evidenced by greatly
significant decrease in IC50 values (P < 0.001) of 14.43 ± 0.27,
12.80 ± 0.47 and 6.43 ± 0.32 μg/ml, respectively. Meanwhile,
the resistance index was also decreasing as 6.53, 5.79 and 2.91,
respectively.
As demonstrated in Fig. 5, the IC50 values were reduced
with the increase of REGO concentration during induction,
resulting in a leftward shift of the concentration-response
curve. In the present study, REGO performed intensive effects
on reversing drug resistance of HepG-2 cells in vitro. These
results demonstrated the potentiation of the anticancer
effects of miriplatin in drug resistant cells by REGO, suggesting
the concept that REGO microspheres might perform the
potential of antagonizing miriplatin resistance continuously
when co-administered in clinical TACE.

3.6.

In vitro cytotoxicity studies

The above results of REGO function on the resistant cell lines
indicated that REGO could increase the sensitivity of HepG2
cells to miriplatin. The in vitro biological activity in groups
of blank microspheres, REGO microspheres, miriplatin, and
REGO microspheres plus miriplatin were further assessed
for cytotoxicity. The viability of HepG2 cells with various
preparations were shown in Fig. 6. Supernatants from blank
microspheres were non-cytotoxic and adopted as control. It
was found that supernatants from REGO microspheres and

Fig. 6 – Cytotoxic effects of sample supernatants obtained

miriplatin alone or in combination significantly inhibited cell
proliferation compared to the control group at the indicated
time points (Fig. 6). Interestingly, it exhibited significant
inhibition of the combinatorial group compared to the
monotherapy for different incubated time (1 d, 3 d or 7 d).
It is worth noting that with the increase of incubation time,
the inhibitory effect of the combinatorial group was more
remarkable. The cell viability of HepG2 in the combinatorial
group for one day-incubation was 31.2% compared to the
miriplatin monotherapy group of 41.4%, while that for 7
d-incubation was only 8.2% compared to the miriplatin
monotherapy group of 30.4%.
The superior efficacy in combinatorial treatment group
could inhibit or block the related factors of cell proliferation
and survival with different mechanisms of action. Moreover,
the outstanding functions of REGO might contribute
to the decrease of the drug resistance of HepG2 cells
induced by miriplatin. Accordingly, REGO could obtain
the similar therapeutic outcomes in combination with
other conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Synergistic
antitumor effects were observed with the addition of REGO to
5-fluorouracil in multiple human colorectal cancer cell lines
[41]. In another study, it was found that REGO potentiated
antitumor effect of topotecan in the mitoxantrone-resistant
xenograft model [42]. The results presented in Fig. 6 indicated
that REGO microspheres could continuously enhance
miriplatin cytotoxic activity in vitro and might be effectively
applied in TACE together with miriplatin.

3.7.

In vitro HUVECs tube-formation assay

From above in vitro cytotoxicity studies, REGO microspheres
have demonstrated the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation.
In order to evaluate the anti-angiogenesis effect of REGO
microspheres, HUVECs tube formation assay was performed
in different samples for 7 d incubation, in which VEGF
inhibitor (bevacizumab) as positive control. As shown in
3.8.

In vivo pharmacokinetics study

To further confirm the sustained release of REGO from the
microspheres in vivo, plasma levels of miriplatin (Pt) and
REGO measured at predetermined time points after TACE
were shown in Fig. 8. Plasma concentrations of miriplatin
(Pt) decreased slowly; and the concentration was still at
192.8 ng/ml after 30 d, that was approximately half of Cmax
(395.2 ng/ml). Meanwhile, plasma concentrations of REGO
decreased slowly, of which the concentration was maintained
at 1.0 ng/ml until 30 d, approximately 2/5 of Cmax (2.5 ng/ml).
As listed in Table 4, the plasma elimination half-life (T1/2 ) for
miriplatin (Pt) and REGO was 607.9 h and 576.8 h, respectively.
The results revealed that REGO could be released from
microspheres sustainably for more than 30 d in vivo. This
sustained release kinetics in vivo might potentiate therapeutic
effects continuously after TACE as we proposed.

model

In vivo antitumor efficacy in HepG2 xenograft tumor

Considering the promising in vitro biological activity and
desirable PK profiles, the in vivo pharmacological efficacy
was further investigated in a HepG2 xenograft tumor model.
In the experimental process, body weight of animals in each
group was stable. It suggested that the experimental doses in
all groups were tolerable. As shown in Fig. 9A, we found an
obvious retardation of tumor growth for animals treated with
REGO microspheres, miriplatin alone, or in combination, as
compared to the control group. Most importantly, treatment
with the combination of REGO microspheres and miriplatin
could significantly enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy
for miriplatin alone, as evidenced by more remarkable
slow-down for tumor growth in relative to the miriplatin

monotherapy group (P < 0.05). On day 17, animals in blank
microspheres group performed a high average tumor weight
of 1.62 g (Fig. 9B). The animals treated with miriplatin alone,
REGO microspheres, and in combination exhibited lower
mean tumor weight of 0.70 g, 0.56 g and 0.48 g, respectively.
A significantly lower mean tumor weight was obvious for
miriplatin plus REGO microspheres compared to miriplatin
alone (P < 0.05).
The results in Fig. 9 supported our design that the local
sustained release of anti-angiogenic REGO from microspheres
could potentiate the anticancer efficacy of chemotherapeutic
miriplatin in HepG2 xenograft tumor model. There were
promising therapeutic effects of locally delivering antiangiogenic REGO with TACE for treatment of liver cancers.
The improved therapeutic effects generated from REGO
microspheres could result from the mechanism of action of
REGO in treatment. As detection, the tumor cell proliferation
was inhibited by REGO, similar to other chemotherapeutic
drugs. This was suggested in Fig. 6 regarding in vitro

cytotoxic effect of REGO released from microspheres
on HepG2 cells. Moreover, REGO could also suppress
multiple protein kinases, such as stromal and angiogenic
kinases (VEGFR, TIE2, PDGFR-β and FGFR), tumorigenic
kinases (KIT, RET, RAF-1, BRAF and mutant BRAF). These
kinases could promote tumor neovascularization, vessel
stabilization and lymphatic vessel formation and thus play
an important role in tumor microenvironment, which was
contributed to tumor deterioration and metastasis [13,43,44].
Therefore, REGO could suppress the angiogenesis by reducing
associated protein kinases induced by TACE. Indeed, the
anti-angiogenic effect of REGO mediated by microspheres
have been demonstrated in Fig. 7. Moreover, the effects of
REGO-mediated normalization of the tumor vasculature
might elevate the efficacy of miriplatin monotherapy.
Previous study demonstrated that REGO could normalize
the tumor vasculature when combined with irinotecan
in oxaliplatin-refractory patient-derived colorectal cancer
xenografts, and the combination significantly delayed

tumor growth [45]. As mentioned in a previous report,
anti-angiogenic agents with tumor normalizing potential
have also documented antitumor activity against HCC [46].
Last but not least, REGO could reduce the drug resistance of
HepG-2 induced by miriplatin, as demonstrated in our in vitro
investigation (Fig. 5). Numerous studies have shown that REGO
would antagonize drug resistance and provide an improved
treatment efficacy combined with chemotherapy [40,42,47].

3.10.

Outlook

The REGO-loaded PLGA microspheres provide more
possibilities in adjusting drug loading, particle size and
drug release. When altering PLGA type (molecular weight,
the ration of lactic to glycolic acid), formulation composition,
and preparation process, we could fine-tune the above
characterizations for clinical application, which is especially
meaningful for TACE treatment. As a result of the numerous
factors for the therapeutic effect of TACE such as tumor
burden, liver functions, and response to previous treatments,
there was not any standardized protocol in TACE including
chemotherapeutic drugs, dosage, injection rate, time interval
between treatments and etc. [2,34]. In our study, PLGA
microspheres was able to carry multiple chemotherapeutic
drugs or drug combinations, with adjustable drug loading,
particle size and drug release profiles, thus as a platform
technology useful for TACE personalized therapy.
With
the
development
of
molecular
targeted
antiangiogenic therapy and recent advances in understanding
HCC pathophysiology, the novel targeted combination
strategies are emerging. The REGO microspheres prepared for
TACE in this study have performed the promising benefits to
improving the effects of TACE, and could be a novel therapy
regiment for TACE. In addition to antiangiogenic effects, REGO
shared a certain cytotoxic efficacy and mediated capacity
of normalization of the tumor vasculature and potential
to overcome drug resistance of chemotherapy, which was

contributed to the increased therapeutic potency of TACE. Due
to the complexity of HCC treatment including TACE balance
between the therapeutic effect and unexpected stimulation
of tumor angiogenesis, the optimal dose and regimen of REGO
in combination with TACE needs to be extensively explored
further.
In the present study, our preliminary in vivo results via
adopting simpler administration in mice were promising
to prove the concept of novel treatment strategy; however,
it is worthy further in vivo study. In this regard, REGO
microspheres will be administrated via TACE into animals
bearing liver tumor. For example, rabbit VX2 liver tumor model
which is a common animal model for evaluating therapeutic
safety and effect in TACE [48–50], may be adopted in future
studies including pharmacokinetics and antitumor effects, if
resources allow.

Conclusions

In this study, PLGA microspheres has been introduced
to incorporate an orally multikinase inhibitor REGO. The
fabricated REGO microspheres provided sustained drug
release for more than 30 d in vitro and in vivo after TACE.
The microspheres demonstrated enhanced cytotoxic effects
of miriplatin on HepG2 cells in vitro. More interestingly,
an intense anti-angiogenic effect and the potential of
antagonizing chemotherapeutic miriplatin resistance were
observed in vitro. Moreover, in vivo investigation in a
HepG2 xenograft tumor model demonstrated the outstanding
antitumor efficacy of REGO microspheres significantly in
superior to miriplatin monotherapy. In summary, the results
of this study demonstrated that REGO microspheres for
local delivery as a novel combination strategy with TACE
may enhance the therapeutic potency of TACE for the
treatment of HCC, and has promising clinical implications in
future.
