Magnesium aluminium silicate
Propranolol hydrochloride
Isothermal titration calorimetry
Complexation

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) along with attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were employed to investigate the process of adsorption of
propranolol hydrochloride (PPN) onto magnesium aluminium silicate (MAS) and to characterise the MAS-PPN
particles formed upon complexation. The composition of MAS was confirmed by infrared (IR) spectroscopy and a
calcimeter. The calorimetric results confirmed the binding between PPN and MAS at various pHs and temperatures. The overall change in enthalpy was found to be exothermic with a comparatively small entropic
contribution to the total change in Gibbs free energy. These findings suggest that the binding process was
enthalpically driven and entropically unfavourable (lower affinity) suggesting hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions dominating the interaction. The variation of pH and temperature did not have a great impact
on the thermodynamics of the binding process, as observed from the similarity in enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS) or
Gibbs free energy (ΔG). A slight reduction in the binding affinity (Ka) with varing pH and temperature was
however observed. SEM/EDX studies showed the occurrence of changes in the microstructural properties of MAS
following complexation which may explain the potential of MAS-PPN complexes for controlled drug release
promoting pharmaceutical innovation.

1. Introduction
Sustained-release drug formulation is of high importance as it
achieves optimal therapeutic efficacy in chronic conditions where
treatment must be administered at constant levels over a period of time,
and provides a reduced frequency of side effects (Aulton, 2007). In
recent years, excipients such as clay minerals have often been used as
carriers of active ingredients to retard or modulate drug release
(Trikeriotis and Ghanotakis, 2007; Park et al., 2008; Joshi et al., 2009;
Meng et al., 2009; Pongjanyakul et al., 2009; Rojtanatanya and
Pongjanyakul, 2010). Their physicochemical properties make them
suitable to be used in the formulation of pharmaceutical dosage forms,
as they can adsorb the active ingredient onto their structure and form
complex dispersions and particles (Carretero and Pozo, 2009;
Pongjanyakul et al., 2009; Rojtanatanya and Pongjanyakul, 2010;

Kanjanakawinkul et al., 2013; Rongthong et al., 2013). These have been
shown to modify the release of drugs upon administration, which would
be desirable for drugs having a short half-life and require frequent
administration to maintain adequate drug plasma levels (Rojtanatanya
and Pongjanyakul, 2010).
Magnesium aluminium silicate (MAS) used in this research is a
mixture of natural smectite montmorillonite and saponite clays, often
used to improve the physical characteristics of drugs and to control
their release (Pongjanyakul et al., 2009; Kanjanakawinkul et al., 2013).
MAS has a high surface area, a very good affinity with cationic drugs
and it is neither toxic nor irritant, therefore being suitable to be used
within drug formulation. MAS has a layered silicate structure, formed of
one alumina or magnesia octahedral sheet, sandwiched between two
tetrahedral silicate sheets (Fig. 1) (Kanjanakawinkul et al., 2013). Hydration in polar liquids easily allows the delamination of MAS platelets,

ITC experiments with multiple discrete injections have previously been
used to provide accurate and important information about the mechanisms of binding of molecules (Callies and Hernández Daranas,
2016). Single injections experiments are faster and versatile, as the user
can generate the binding isotherm in one third to half the time a
multiple injection experiment takes, allowing the rapid determination
of the suitable conditions and parameters for the reaction, as well as the
driving forces to the reaction (Malvern Instruments, 2015). To perform
an experiment, the instrument periodically injects a ligand (guest solution) into the calorimetric cell containing an analyte (host solution)
under isothermal conditions (Fig. 2) (Duff et al., 2011). The heat absorbed or released as chemical bonds form or break is then measured as
the power that must be supplied to maintain both sample and reference
cells at a constant temperature (Moore et al., 2016; Di Trani et al.,
2017). Experiments can be performed under different conditions, such
as variable temperatures or buffer giving detailed information about the
studied systems (Duff et al., 2011). Independent binding sites, sequential binding sites, competitive binding and dissociation models can
be fitted to the resulting data to yield binding site size, affinity (Ka),
changes in enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS) or Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and
stoichiometry (N) of the binding events (Moore et al., 2016). For a
simple single binding site model, the non-linear least squares fit of the
data can be used to determine Ka and ΔH, followed by the calculation of
ΔG and ΔS using the known relationship between the van’t Hoff
equation and change in Gibbs free energy:

which would otherwise be very difficult to achieve mechanically, due to
the binding effect of counter ions and water found between platelets.
Water easily forces the clay platelets further apart as it penetrates between them (osmosis) and hence cations diffuse away from platelet
faces (diffusion) (Vanderbilt Minerals, 2014a,b). This allows the exposure of the negative face of the clay platelets which, in turn, allows
the adsorption of cationic drugs via electrostatic interactions (Nunes
et al., 2007; Pongjanyakul et al., 2009; Rojtanatanya and Pongjanyakul,
2010).
The present study investigates a potential clay-based formulation of
a model cationic drug propranolol hydrochloride (PPN) selected on the
basis of its important therapeutic effect but short half-life. PPN represents the first of drugs acting as antagonists at β-adrenergic receptors of the heart (β-blockers), developed in the 1960s and introduced in 1964 (Patrick, 2001; Rojtanatanya and Pongjanyakul,
2010). Its therapeutic effect comes from antagonizing the adrenergic
pathway that can lead to blocking receptors in heart, lungs, liver,
pancreas, peripheral blood vessels and other parts of the body. It is used
to treat angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and high blood pressure.
However, due to its high solubility in water, PPN has a short half-life of
3.9 h and hence, it needs to be administered frequently (2–3 times/day)
in order to maintain adequate drug plasma levels (Datta, 2013). The
development of sustained-release dosage forms would be beneficial,
increasing patient compliance, safety and efficacy of the drug.
Here, the authors have studied the adsorption of PPN onto MAS
using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC), attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy
with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX).
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is the only technique able to
completely characterise the thermodynamics of an interaction in a
single experiment (MicroCal, 1998). ITC is a powerful well-established
biophysical technique used to measure the formation and dissociation
of molecular complexes in many branches of science from cell biology
to food chemistry. ITC can be successfully used to study interactions
using a wide variety of samples such as clays, polymers, metals, proteins, enzymes, hormones, antibodies and nanoparticles (Ladbury and
Chowdhry, 1996; Penn and Warren, 2009; Le et al., 2013). Traditional

where T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin and R is the gas

The change in heat capacity of the binding interaction at constant
pressure (ΔCp) may also be determined by undertaking experiments at
additional temperatures. ΔCp is determined from the temperature dependence of ΔH using Eq. (2) (MicroCal, 1998; Le et al., 2013):

In certain cases, more complex models (with equilibria involving

of the binding event (Le et al., 2013; Callies and Hernández Daranas,
2016). A spontaneous interaction will have a negative ΔG and, as the
binding increases in strength, ΔG will also become increasingly negative. ΔG for a binding isotherm has both an entropic and an enthalpic
contribution.
The present study aimed at exploiting ITC in giving insights to the
binding that occurs in clays and model cationic drugs through the observation of the process in real time and determination of the driving
forces that could potentially affect drug release. The real-time process
of adsorption of cationic drugs onto clay minerals has not been described prior to this study and as such understanding it is a critical step
in establishing a successful formulation thus promoting pharmaceutical
innovation.

double drug loaded complexes) were scanned from 4000 to 400 cm−1.

2. Experimental

2.2.3. Drug content analysis from single and double loaded MAS-PPN
complexes
Drug content within the single and double loaded MAS-PPN complexes was determined by dispersing 50 mg of the prepared single or
double drug loaded MAS-PPN complex particles in 100 mL of a 2 M HCl,
ultra–pure water or pH 6.8 phosphate buffer under continuous stirring
for 24 h, at 25 °C and 700 rpm. The suspensions obtained were then
filtered using 0.2 µm syringe filters. The clear supernatant was analysed
using HPLC (Section 2.2.4) to determine drug content in the MAS–PPN
complexes. The experiments were performed in triplicate to ensure
reproducibility.

2.2.2.2. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (SEM/EDX). The surface morphology in 3D and the
energy spectrum of samples was analysed using a QUANTA FEG 250
microscope equipped with an EDX to detect changes that occurred
following the complexation process. The electronic beam voltage of the
microscope was set at 20 kV. A small amount of either PPN, MAS or the
single and double loaded MAS-PPN complexed samples was mounted
on a metal stub with double-sided adhesive tape and sputter coated
with a thin layer of gold (1–5 nm) under vacuum (argon atmosphere).
Various magnifications were taken of the micrographs to aid in the
study of the complexes.

2.1. Materials
VEEGUM F EP® (Magnesium Aluminium Silicate) was a gift from
R.T.Vanderbilt Company, Norwalk, CT (USA). Its composition was
confirmed by infrared (IR) spectroscopy and using a calcimeter. The
calcimeter used works in accordance to the method of Scheibler which
determines the carbonate content using a volumetric method
(Calcimeter Manual, 2018). The method involves the addition of hydrochloric acid to the clay sample which leads to the conversion of the
carbonates into CO2. The amount of CO2 released produces a difference
in pressure which is measured on a burette filled with water and deaerated. The difference in level on the burette is used to calculate the
carbonate content as an equivalent calcium carbonate content. This
material therefore complies with the European Pharmacopoeia monograph for Magnesium Aluminium Silicate and is indicated for use as a
dry excipient in pressed powders and in direct compression tablets
(Vanderbilt Minerals, 2014a). Propranolol hydrochloride was supplied
from TCI (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo). Acetonitrile (HPLC grade),
sodium phosphate dibasic dihydrate, 99+% (HPLC grade), 2 M sodium
hydroxide and 2 M hydrochloric acid were purchased from Fisher Scientific (UK).

2.2.4. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography was performed using a Shimadzu HPLC system (Shimadzu, Japan), equipped
with an SPD-20AV UV–Vis detector, using an XTerra® MS C18
150 mm × 4.6 mm × 3.5 μm column. The mobile phase was prepared
using acetonitrile and 0.01 M sodium phosphate dibasic dihydrate (pH
3.5) at a ratio of 30:70 v/v. The flow rate of the mobile phase was set at
1 mL/min with a detection wavelength of 230 nm.
2.2.4.1. Method validation. The HPLC method used was validated by
the following parameters: linearity range, precision, limit of
quantitation (LOQ) and limit of detection (LOD) (Modamio et al.,
1996). Linearity was evaluated over a series of drug stock solutions
ranging from 100 to 0.1 µg/mL, prepared with appropriate volumes. A
calibration graph was then generated by plotting the peak area versus
the corresponding drug concentration (R2 ≥ 0.999). The results were
recorded in triplicate on three different days. The intra and inter day
precision was determined from an assay of freshly prepared 1, 10, 50
and 100 µg/mL standard drug solutions, repeatedly run on the same day
or on three different days. Results were evaluated statistically in terms
of standard deviation (RSD %) (Ich, 2005). The intermediate and intra
assay precision at three different concentration levels was lower than
2% RSD which complied with the acceptable criteria for quality control
of pharmaceutical preparations (Ermer and Ploss, 2005; Chatpalliwar
et al., 2012).
As a consequence of the basic nature of PPN, its analysis using HPLC
was prone to peak tailing and poor peak shape from column overloading (McCalley, 2010; Sadeghi et al., 2013). Therefore, the sensitivity of the method is important in ensuring a good peak resolution and
efficiency to avoid sample overloading (Sadeghi et al., 2013). The LOQ
confirming the lowest drug concentration that can be recovered within
acceptable limits of precision and accuracy was found to be 2.30 µg/
mL, indicating the high sensitivity of the proposed method and its
suitability for the detection of PPN in solution at low concentrations
(Table 1). Furthermore, the LOD was determined to be 0.76 µg/mL
which also highlighted the sensitivity of the method.

2.2. Methods
2.2.1. Formulation of MAS-PPN complex particles
MAS dispersions (2% w/v) and PPN solutions (2% w/v) were separately prepared under continuous stirring at 500 rpm (25 °C) for 24 h
and 30 min respectively. The pH of MAS dispersions and PPN solutions
prepared was further adjusted to pH 5 using 2 M hydrochloric acid and
2 M sodium hydroxide. For single drug loading, one PPN solution was
combined with one of the MAS dispersions prepared, and the obtained
dispersion (1:1 w/w) was incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm
for 24 h (GLS Aqua 18 Plus, Linear Shaking Water Bath, Grant
Instruments). The MAS–PPN complex dispersion formed was then filtered using a Buchner filtration apparatus with vacuum. For the second
drug loading, previously filtered single drug loaded complexes prepared
was redispersed into a fresh drug solution (at pH 5) and incubated at
37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for 24 h. The single and double loaded
MAS–PPN complex dispersions obtained were then filtered and dried in
the oven at 50 °C for 48 h. The complexed particles obtained were
ground using a Retsch® PM 100 Ball Mill set at 350 rpm. The ground
samples were sieved to a particle size fraction of 123–65 µm and stored
in a glass vial until needed.
2.2.2. Characterisation of MAS-PPN complexes
2.2.2.1. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). ATR-FTIR was used to elucidate the
molecular interaction between MAS and PPN. Experiments were
performed on a Smart Orbit ATR-FTIR machine, using diamond as the

of PPN onto MAS at the pH values studied. Furthermore, the evolved
heat in the experiments was analysed through a single set of sites curve
fitting using a non-linear least squares model. This allowed the determination of the association constant Ka and the thermodynamic
parameters ΔH, ΔG and ΔS.
Calorimetric multiple injection mode (MIM) binding studies were
carried out at pH 5 and at two different temperatures (25 °C and 37 °C).
The real-time binding isotherm was studied with 120 injections of 2 μL
each into the sample cell every 260 s. MAS dispersion (0.037% w/v)
and PPN solutions (0.150% w/v) were prepared as detailed previously.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Chemical overview of MAS
The constituents of the MAS were confirmed to be a mixture of clay
minerals and carbonates (Table 2). The high percentage of magnesia
and alumina confirms the presence of both montmorillonite and saponite clays within the material (Table 2) (Kanjanakawinkul et al., 2013).
Low quantities of ferric oxide, calcium oxide, potassium oxide and sodium oxide, as well as trace amounts of titanium oxide were observed,
confirming the presence of exchangeable cations adsorbed onto the clay
structure via electrostatic interactions. A loss on ignition of 11.90%
resulted from the loss of water, organic matter and carbonates upon
heating the sample between 120 and 150 °C (Weems, 1903). The MAS
sample was further analysed by heating it to 900–1100 °C. This process
produced 3.06% CO2 which was a result of the thermal decomposition
of the carbonates.

3.2.1. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(ATR-FTIR)
ATR-FTIR was used to study the adsorption onto MAS of PPN based
on the vibration of chemical bonds formed (Fig. 4). The spectrum of
MAS alone indicated the presence of the hydroxyl group belonging to
SieOH at 3625 cm−1 and SieOeSi stretching at 980 cm−1
(Rojtanatanya and Pongjanyakul, 2010). Also, a broad peak at
3415 cm−1 (OeH stretching of water residues) and a sharp peak at
1640 cm−1 (hydroxyl group bending of water of crystallization) were
observed (Rojtanatanya and Pongjanyakul, 2010). The spectrum of PPN

acceptable limits (Fig. 3) (Baranauskiene et al., 2009). Calorimetric
binding studies were undertaken using a VP-ITC micro calorimeter
(Malvern Panalytical, UK) with the MAS dispersion in the sample cell
and the PPN solution in the syringe. The instrument was used in highgain feedback mode, applying a reference power of 20 μcal s−1 whilst
stirring 307 rpm. The acidity of the working media (pH 5, 7, 9) in this
study was chosen based on the pKa value of PPN (9. 5) (Shalaeva et al.,
2007; Rojtanatanya and Pongjanyakul, 2010; ACD I-Lab, 2018). At
these pHs, PPN is expected to be adsorbed onto the negatively charged
MAS as it is ionised. 2 M hydrochloric acid and 2 M sodium hydroxide
were used in adjusting the pH (ACD I-Lab, 2018). The results were
analysed using Origin 7.0 (Microcal, Inc) software. Experiments were
repeated in triplicate to ensure reproducibility.
Calorimetric single injection mode (SIM) binding studies were carried out at 25 °C and three different pH values, 5, 7 and 9 to characterise the process of adsorbing PPN onto MAS and to identify the most
suitable conditions and parameters for the reaction. The drug solution
was added as one 150 µL injection into the sample cell. MAS dispersions
(0.037% w/v) and PPN solutions (0.150% w/v) were prepared using
purified water under continuous stirring at 500 rpm (25 °C) for 24 h and
30 min respectively prior to analysis. The pH of the prepared solutions
and dispersions was further adjusted to 5, 7 and 9. The binding isotherm was analysed by comparing the reaction rate for the adsorption

attributed to aryl alkyl ether stretching, whilst the peak at 970 cm−1
was attributed to the naphthalene group within PPN (Rojtanatanya and

presence of high amounts of silicon, aluminium and magnesium, as well
as trace amounts of iron, calcium, sodium, titanium and potassium
(Fig. 5). The high percentage of silicon, magnesium and aluminium
confirmed the presence of both montmorillonite and saponite clays
within the material, whereas the other elements may indicate its provenience (Kanjanakawinkul et al., 2013). The results were thus in
agreement with that produced by the IR and calcimeter (Table 2). PPN
was shown to be formed of large crystalline particles having smooth
surfaces (Fig. 6). EDX analysis of PPN confirmed the presence of distinctive elements such as chlorine and nitrogen.
The analysis of the single and double drug loaded MAS-PPN complex particles using SEM/EDX (Figs. 7 & 8) indicated that both samples
were similar, yet different when compared with MAS and PPN alone.
These results indicate that changes in the microstructural properties of
the clay powder occurred following the complexation process which
may explain why the formed MAS-PPN complexes can be used to offer
controlled drug release (Rojtanatanya and Pongjanyakul, 2010;
Pongjanyakul and Rojtanatanya, 2012). The analysis of atomic distribution in the single and double drug loaded MAS-PPN complex
particles revealed the presence of elements belonging to both PPN and
MAS which was expected.

shifted to a lower wavelength at approximately 3631 cm−1. Peaks attributed to the secondary hydroxyl and amine groups within PPN were
no longer visible. Hence, the change and disappearance of peaks from
both MAS and PPN confirmed PPN adsorption onto MAS, via hydrogen
bond formation between the silanol groups of MAS with the amine and/
or hydroxyl groups of PPN (Rojtanatanya and Pongjanyakul, 2010).
3.2.2. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (SEM/EDX)
SEM images of the MAS particles were shown to be aggregated together in comparatively large clusters (Fig. 5) (Mita, Rupa and
Achowicz, 2010; Pongjanyakul and Rojtanatanya, 2012). Individual
flakes were also observed on the surface upon increasing magnification
which represents the tetrahedral and octahedral sheets which are
characteristic of phyllosilicates (Carrado and Bergaya, 2007). The
atomic distribution onto the MAS surface using EDX revealed the

3.3. Recovery of PPN content from MAS–PPN complex particles
Drug recovery from the single and double drug loaded MAS–PPN
complex particles was influenced by the dissolution media used
(Table 3). A higher amount of PPN was recovered from the complexes
in 2 M HCl and pH 6.8 buffer compared with ultra-pure water suggesting that the polydispersity of MAS particles was influenced by the

cations present in the dissolution media (Rojtanatanya and
Pongjanyakul, 2010). An increase in the PPN content was also observed
in the MAS–PPN double drug loaded complexes suggesting that there
were still available binding sites onto MAS after adsorption equilibrium
was reached following the single drug loading which allowed further
adsorption of PPN particles (Rojtanatanya and Pongjanyakul, 2010). It
is key to note that no impurities or degradants were observed. This
information is of high importance as it can affect the accurate

quantification of PPN from MAS–PPN complexes which, in turn, can
impact on the formulation of a tablet dosage form.

exothermic and became more energetic as pH decreased, indicated by
the peak returning more rapidly to the baseline (Fig. 9a). This can be
attributed to the ionisation of the drug (pka 9. 5) (Shalaeva et al., 2007;
Rojtanatanya and Pongjanyakul, 2010; ACD I-Lab, 2018). It is important to note also that the MAS polydispersity may be affected by the
ions in the solution which, in turn can affect the rate of adsorption of
PPN onto MAS (Rojtanatanya and Pongjanyakul, 2010). SIM experiments through a single set of sites curve fitting using a non-linear least
squares model allowed the observation of behaviour of adsorption of
PPN onto MAS with varying pH (Fig. 9b–d and Table 4). In all cases, the
overall change in enthalpy was found to be exothermic with a comparatively small entropic contribution to the total change in Gibbs free
energy. These findings firstly imply that the binding phenomenon was
predominantly enthalpically driven as high energy resulted from
broken and created hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions.
Secondly the similarity in values implies that pH did not affect the
thermodynamics of the binding process. The binding affinity (Ka)
slightly decreased with varing pH (Table 4) suggesting that at pH 5 the
adsorption process was more energetic and the conditions for the reaction were optimum. The ITC data is thus in agreement with previous
results published in literature showing that the adsorption of PPN onto
MAS is enthalpically driven and entropically unfavourable suggesting
hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions dominate the interaction (Rojtanatanya and Pongjanyakul, 2010; Pongjanyakul and
Rojtanatanya, 2012).

dissolution media used, information which can impact on the formulation of a tablet dosage form. Changes in the microstructural
properties of the clay powder following the complexation process were
also observed which may explain why the formed MAS-PPN complexes
could be used to offer controlled drug release strategies. ATR-FTIR
confirmed PPN adsorption onto MAS, via hydrogen bond formation
between the silanol groups of MAS with the amine and/or hydroxyl
groups of PPN based on the vibration of chemical bonds formed. The
detailed information presented in this study on the binding energetics
and behaviour between PPN and MAS is of great importance to a formulator in the development of complexes for the manipulation of drug
release.

3.4.2. Multiple injection mode
Multiple injection experiments at pH 5 and at two different temperatures (25 and 37 °C) further confirmed the highly exothermic interaction between PPN and MAS (Fig. 10), as observed in the SIM ITC
experiments. The MIM stepwise experiments however gave detailed and
more accurate information about the driving forces involved in the
adsorption process compared with the SIM experiments. In agreement
with previous SIM experiments, binding was characterised by a negative enthalpy change, and a comparatively small entropy change, i.e.
implying that it was an enthalpically driven process (Fig. 10). The adsorption process of PPN onto MAS was shown to be similar at both 25
and 37 °C (Fig. 10b and d). The increase in temperature slightly decreased the affinity of PPN with MAS as observed from the reduction of
the association constant Ka (2.61E+04 ± 2.71E+03 M at 25 °C and
1.48E+04 ± 1.48E+03 M at 37 °C). The overall change in Gibbs free
energy (ΔG) was comparatively similar at both temperatures
(−6.03 ± 0.06 kcal/mol (−25.23 ± 0.25 kJ/mol) at 25 °C compared
with −5.97 ± 1.37 kcal/mol (−24.98 ± 5.73 kJ) at 37 °C), confirming both reactions occurred spontaneously. The enthalpic contribution calculated from the change in heat associated with binding
was greater at 37 °C (−11.37 ± 1.36 kcal/mol (47.57 ± 5.69 kJ)
compared with −8.54 ± 0.32 kcal/mol (−35.73 ± 1.34 kJ) at 25 °C),
while the entropic contribution was comparatively small in both cases
confirming the interaction to be enthalpically driven at both temperatures. The binding interaction had a negative heat capacity ΔCp
(−0.24 kcal mol K−1/ −1.00 kJ mol K−1) indicating that upon increasing temperature the binding became more exothermic and enthalpically driven, thus in agreement with the binding parameters
calculated.
4. Conclusion
This study demonstrated the affinity of PPN for MAS and provided
insights into its binding energetics. The process was shown to be exothermic, enthalpically driven and entropically unfavourable (lower affinity) suggesting hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions
dominating the interaction. A simple, accurate and precise reversedphase HPLC method was developed for quantitative determination of
PPN from the single and double drug loaded MAS–PPN complex particles which showed that PPN recovery was influenced by the
