Abstract
Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (formerly known as the 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than 75,000 cases have been reported in 32 countries/regions, resulting in more than 2000 deaths worldwide. Despite the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities were reported in China, the WHO has declared this outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. The COVID-19 can present as an asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia. Adults represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates, children, and elderly patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible. The most common finding on chest imaging among patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with bilateral involvement. Severe cases are more likely to be older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases. Indeed, age and disease severity may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19. To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China. Currently, effective infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia due to unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread
throughout the country within 1 month. The pathogen of
this disease was confirmed as a novel coronavirus by molecular methods and was initially named as 2019 novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV); however, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a new name on February 11,
2020 for the epidemic disease: Corona Virus Disease
(COVID-19). To date, COVID-19 has affected people in more
than 28 countries/regions, including Taiwan, and has
become a global threat.1e4 In addition, the Coronavirus
Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy
of Viruses has renamed the virus, which was provisionally
named 2019-nCoV, as severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on phylogeny, taxonomy,
and established practice.5 Prior to this, on January 30,
2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak as the sixth
public health emergency of international concern; therefore, this outbreak constitutes a public health risk through
the international spread of disease and requires a coordinated international response. Increased dissemination of
information through use of the internet is associated with
increased transmission of information from all geographical
regions and across disciplines regarding recognition of
SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-196; nevertheless, important factors
associated with COVID-19, specifically age and sex distribution, incubation period, clinical features, and optimal
treatment, remain uncertain. Therefore, herein, we performed a literature review, focusing on the epidemiological
characteristics and clinical manifestations of COVID-19,
including asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory
disease (ARD), and pneumonia.

Main

Severity of COVID-19
COVID-19 was defined as the respiratory disease caused by
SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in China in 2019 (https://www.
who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid-19).
The
clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are protean, which
include asymptomatic carrier, ARD, and pneumonia of
varying degrees of severity. First, asymptomatic cases were
diagnosed based on positive viral nucleic acid test results,
but without any COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever,

gastrointestinal, or respiratory symptoms, and no significant abnormalities on chest radiograph7,8 However, the
transmission of COVID-19 through asymptomatic carriers via
person-to-person contact was observed in many reports.4,7,9,10 Second, patients with ARD defined as
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases had respiratory
symptoms; however, chest computed tomography (CT) did
not reveal signs of pneumonia.11 Third, patients with
pneumonia defined as COVID-19 cases had both respiratory
symptoms and pneumonia on chest radiograph. This category includes severe pneumonia e either respiratory rate
30/minute, SpO2  93%, or PaO2/FiO2  300 mmHg, and a
critical condition, characterized by respiratory failure
requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or other organ
failure requiring ICU management.8

Epidemiology
As of February 21, 2020, data from the WHO revealed
altogether 76,769 cases of COVID-19.1 Thirty-two countries
or regions have reported confirmed cases, including mainland China, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan,
Australia, Malaysia, Germany, Vietnam, the United States,
Macao SAR, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, France, the
Philippines, the United Kingdom, Italy, India, Russia,
Finland, Sweden, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Nepal, Spain,
Belgium, Iran, Egypt, Israel, and Lebanon. In addition, 643
cases were found in international conveyance e Diamond
Princess. China has the largest number of patients with
COVID-19 (n Z 75,543), followed by South Korea (n Z 204),
Japan (n Z 93), and Singapore (n Z 85). To date, the reported number of deaths is 2247 and only 11 occurred
outside of mainland China, including two each in Hong Kong
Special administrative regions (SAR), Iran, and Diamond
Princess, and one each in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan,
Philippines, and France. However, asymptomatic patients
or patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms may not seek
health care, nor receive diagnosis, which leads to underestimation of the burden of COVID-19.

Age and sex
Initially, most reported COVID-19 cases in Wuhan were
adult patients; however, all of these cases had pneumonia.12e14 Their median or mean ages were 55.5, 49.0, and

406
56 years in three separate studies.12e14 A similar finding
was observed in two recent non-peer-reviewed studies: one
study with 1099 patients from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces
in China, in which the median age was 47.0 years, and
55.1% of the patients were between the ages of 15e49
years; and a second study that included 4021 confirmed
cases in 30 provinces of China, in which the mean age was
49 years and 50.7% of patients were between the ages of
20e50 years.11,15 Both these studies included ARD and
pneumonia cases.11,15 Similarly, the Novel Coronavirus
Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team in
China reported that 66.7% (n Z 29,798) of 44,672 cases of
COVID-19 of varying degrees of severity were between 20
and 60 years of age.8 In Korea, Ryu et al. found that the
initial 15 cases were aged between 25 and 62 years.16
Regarding elderly patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, one
study showed that 14.6% (6 in 41) of patients were aged 65
years,13 while another study showed that 15.2% (15 in 99)
patients were aged 70 years, among pneumonia cases.12
In addition, two non-peer-reviewed studies showed only
153 (15.1%) patients were elderly patients aged 65
years,11 and 407 (10.1%) patients were aged >70 years.15
According to the recent China CDC report,8 12.0%
(n Z 5326) of patients were aged 70 years. Regarding
children with COVID-19, nine (0.9%) patients aged 0e14
years were found in only one study,11 while 14 (0.35%) patients were aged 10 years in another study.15 The largest
study in China showed that 0.9% (n Z 416) of patients were
aged <10 years.8 Further, Wei et al. reported that nine
infants under 1 year of age were infected with SARS-CoV-2
in China.8 Regarding patient sex ratio, male sex comprised
more than half of the cases in most COVID-19 studies11e14
and the proportion of males ranged from 51.4% to
73.2%.8,11e14,16
Initially, approximately half of the cases had Huanan
seafood market exposure and animal-to-human transmission was suspected.12,13 However, fewer cases had
exposure to this seafood market and an increasing number
of cases demonstrated human-to-human transmission.11,17
Fortunately, no evidence was found for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who contracted COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.18 In
addition to family cluster infections due to human-tohuman transmission,19 nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2 is
a serious concern. Indeed, one study in a Zhongnan hospital
of the Wuhan University showed 29.0% (n Z 40) were
medical staff and 12.3% (n Z 17) contracted COVID-19
during hospitalization.14 Two other studies showed that
2.1% (n Z 23) and 3.8% (n Z 1716) of patients were health
workers.8,11

Risk factors
Although the risk factors of COVID-19 remain unclear, many
studies reported that a significant proportion of patients
had underlying conditions.8,11e14 For patients with SARSCoV pneumonia, Chen et al. showed that 50.5% (n Z 51)
of patients had chronic medical illness, namely cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (40.4%).12 Among 1099
patients with SARS-CoV-2 ARD, Guan et al. showed that
23.2% (n Z 255) of patients had at least one coexisting

C.-C. Lai et al.
disorder, and hypertension was the most common underlying disease (14.9%), followed by diabetes mellitus
(7.4%).11 Another large study on COVID-19 cases of varying
degrees of severity also showed that hypertension was the
most common underlying disease (n Z 2,683, 12.8%), followed by diabetes mellitus (n Z 1,102, 5.3%), and cardiovascular disease (n Z 873, 4.2%).8 Moreover, patients with
severe COVID-19 were more likely to have comorbidities
than those with non-severe diseases (37.6% vs. 20.5%,
p < 0.001).11 A similar trend was observed in another study
of 138 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, in
which 46.4% (n Z 64) of patients had comorbidities and the
intensive care unit (ICU) patients were more likely to have
underlying diseases compared to non-ICU patients (72.2%
vs. 37.3%, p < 0.001).14
In summary, these studies disclosed several significant
findings. First, although most patients with COVID-19 were
middle-aged adults, elderly patients and children also
contracted COVID-19. Second, there is a higher prevalence
of men with COVID-19 than that of women; however,
further studies are warranted to confirm this finding. Third,
health care workers and hospitalized patients could be
infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting. Finally, at
least 20% of COVID-19 cases had underlying diseases, and
more severe cases were more likely to have comorbidities
than non-severe cases.

Incubation period
It is essential to know the incubation period, the time
elapsing between the moment of exposure to an infectious
agent and the appearance of signs and symptoms of the
disease, for infection control and guidance for the duration
of isolation. Initially, Li et al. used the data on exposure
among 10 confirmed cases in Wuhan to estimate the mean
incubation period, which was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1e7.0); the 95th percentile of the distribution
was 12.5 days (95% CI, 9.2e18).20 One estimation based on
125 patients with clearly defined exposure periods in China
indicated that the median incubation period was 4.75
(interquartile range: 3.0e7.2) days.15 Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were
detected outside of Wuhan in the early outbreak phase,
Backer et al. estimated that the mean incubation period
was 6.4 days (95% credible interval: 5.6e7.7), ranging from
2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile).21 However,
Guan et al., using a large sample for estimation, suggested
that the median incubation period was only 3.0 days, but
could be as long as 24 days.11 Overall, these estimates will
be refined as more data become available. Detailed
epidemiological information based on a larger sample of
patients infected with COVID-19 is needed to determine the
infectious period of SARS-CoV-2, as well as to determine
whether transmission can occur from asymptomatic individuals during the incubation period.

Clinical manifestations
Previous reports revealed that there are asymptomatic
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.7,8,22 These patients can
spread the virus and may represent a population that can

be easily neglected in epidemic prevention. Therefore, it is
important to identify asymptomatic patients with COVID19. Since these patients are asymptomatic, careful monitoring of the natural course of the disease and contact
history may only identify them. Based on the current data,
we do not know whether these patients are only asymptomatic initially after contracting the disease or if they are
asymptomatic throughout the course of the disease.
Among a pooled analysis of 970 patients with ARD (Table
1) based on two studies with detail clinical characteristics,11,23 males comprised more than half of the patients
and the mean age was 45 years. Hypertension was the most

common underlying disease, followed by diabetes mellitus.
Approximately two-thirds of patients had cough, but only
44.7% patients had fever. In addition, sputum production
was observed in one-third of patients and sore throat was
found in 14.0% of patients. Only fewer than 5% of patients
had gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, nausea,
and vomiting. Meanwhile, 32.4% of patients required oxygen therapy, but none required mechanical ventilation.
Only one patient with ARD died and the mortality rate was
0.1%.
Among a pooled analysis of 468 patients with pneumonia
(Table 2) based on five studies with detailed description of
clinical features of the disease,11e14,23 male sex comprised
60.3% of patients and the mean age was 53 years. Approximately one-fifth of patients reported smoking history.
Hypertension was the most common underlying disease
(20.5%), followed by diabetes mellitus (14.4%). Additionally, 76.3% of patients had fever and 70.5% of patients
presented cough. Furthermore, dyspnea and sputum production were observed in approximately one-third of patients. Moreover, 8% and 6% of patients had nausea/
vomiting or diarrhea, respectively. In all, 70.9% of patients
required oxygen therapy, and 28.8% required mechanical
ventilation. Moreover, 5.1% and 3.1% of patients required
renal replacement therapy and extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation, respectively. The overall mortality was 8.2%
(n Z 37); however, 313 (66.9%) patients remained
hospitalized.
Furthermore, patients with pneumonia were older, with
a higher prevalence of smoking history, more underlying
diseases, and were more likely to have fever, myalgia/fatigue, dyspnea, headache, and nausea/vomiting compared
to patients with ARD (all p < 0.05) (Table 3). In addition,
pneumonia cases presented a higher white blood cell count
and neutrophil count, but had a reduced leukocyte count
compared to ARD cases. Serum procalcitonin levels of
0.5 ng/mL were found in 6.1% (6/99),12 7.7% (3/39),13 to
13.7% (16/117),11 among SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients
reported from three studies.11e13 Moreover, patients with
pneumonia were more likely to require oxygenation therapy, mechanical ventilator, renal replacement, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and received more
antibiotics and antiviral therapy than patients with ARD.
Finally, pneumonia was associated with a higher mortality
rate than ARD (p < 0.0001).

Image
Based on the findings of 1099 ARD cases of COVID, only
14.7% (n Z 162) of patients had an abnormal chest radiograph.11 In contrast, 840 (76.4%) patients had abnormal and
diverse chest CT images, in which ground-glass opacity
(GGO) was the most common abnormality (n Z 550, 65.5%),
followed by local patchy shadowing (n Z 409, 48.7%), and
interstitial abnormalities (n Z 143, 17.0%). In addition, 505
(50.1%) had bilateral involvement.11 The predominance of
GGO and bilateral involvement in chest CT is consistent
with previous studies.24e26 In contrast, other types of abnormalities, such as cavitation, pleural effusion, and
lymphadenopathy, were not found.24,27 As the disease
progressed, follow-up CT showed enlargement and

consolidation of single GGO, an enlarged fibrous stripe, and
solid nodules. In contrast, a small fibrous stripe, as well as
the resolution of GGO, may be associated with improvement in the patient’s condition.28,29

Treatment
Several reports suggest the following as potential drug
candidates, although the clinical effectiveness of these
drugs have not yet been evidenced for COVID-19: lopinavir/
ritonavir (Kaletra), nucleoside analogs, neuraminidase
inhibitors, remdesivir, umifenovir (arbidol), DNA synthesis
inhibitors (such as tenofovir disoproxil, and lamivudine),
chloroquine, ACE2-based peptides, 3C-like protease
(3CLpro) inhibitors, novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor,

teicoplanin, and Chinese traditional medicine (such as
ShuFengJieDu or Lianhuaqingwen capsules).30e39 The
effectiveness of remdesivir is more evident in the literature
to date; indeed, it appears to be the most promising drug
for COVID-19. In fact, an in vitro study demonstrated that
the 50% effective concentration (EC50) of remdesivir against
nCoV-2019/BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 in Vero E6 cells
was 0.77 mM, and the 90% effective concentration (EC90)
was 1.76 mM.31 However, only one case in the US showed a
clinical response to remdesivir, although the viral load
appeared to decline at the time of initiating remdesivir
(cycle threshold from 18e20 to 23e24).33 Subsequently,

COVID-18, were initiated in China, with an estimated end
date in early April 2020. In these two trials, the 10-day
regimen of remdesivir was 100 mg once daily for 9 days
after the loading of 200 mg on day 1.34 Chloroquine is
another promising drug.35,36 An in vitro study on the timeof-addition assay in Vero E6 cells demonstrated that chloroquine functioned at both entry and at post-entry stages
of COVID-19, and the EC90 value of chloroquine against the
2019-nCoV was 6.90 mM.31 In addition, passive immunization
therapy and the use of interferon could theoretically be
helpful, but to date there is no evidence to validate this
hypothesis.
Systemic corticosteroid was administered in 18.6%e
44.9% patients in order to control the inflammatory
response caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 4 initial large studies.11e14 However, corticosteroid therapy could be associated with delayed MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted
hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17e0.72; p Z 0.005) for critically ill patients with MERS,40 and early corticosteroid
treatment could be associated with higher subsequent
plasma RNA load of SARS-CoV for adults with SARS.41
Moreover, corticosteroid-associated psychosis and diabetes were observed in the treatment of SARS.42,43 Thus,
clinical use of corticosteroids in the treatment of COVID-19
was not recommended in the interim, unless indicated for
another reason.44,45

Outcomes
According to WHO reports, the overall mortality rate for
COVID-19 was 2.9% (2247 in 76,769),1 however, the mortality rate varied among studies. Initial studies reported
that the mortality rate associated with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranged from 11%12 to 15%,13 but later studies
revealed that the mortality rate was between 1.4%11 and
4.3%.14 The differences in the results among different
studies could be due to the study population, as well as the
differences among the studies in terms of disease severity.
In addition, these results need further clarification, since a
majority of the reported mortality was all-cause mortality,
not COVID-attributed mortality; also, the outcome measurement was incomplete because many patients remained
hospitalized before publication of the results.
Several prognostic factors of COVID-19 were also reported in these studies. In one study using the MulBSTA
score system,46 which includes six indices, namely multilocular infiltration, lymphopenia, bacterial co-infection,
smoking history, hypertension, and age, revealed that
these indices were poor prognostic factors.12 Another study
showed similar findings, and specifically the indicators of
disease severity, including oxygenation, respiratory rate,
leukocyte/lymphocyte count, and the chest imaging findings, were associated with a poor clinical outcome.11
Moreover, a substantially elevated case-fatality rate
included the following patient characteristics: male sex,
60 years of age, baseline diagnosis of severe pneumonia,
and delay in diagnosis.15 Similarly, the China CDC reported
that patients aged 80 years had the highest case fatality
rate, 14.8%, among different age groups, and the case

410
fatality rate of patients in which disease severity was
critical was 49.0%.8 Together, these findings suggest that
old age and increased disease severity could predict a poor
outcome.
In this stage of lack of effective drugs, the implementation of infection control interventions and traffic
control bundle to effectively limit droplet, contact, and
fomite transmission is the only way to slow the spread of
the SARS-CoV-2. These infection control interventions
include early identification of cases and their contacts,
avoiding close contact with people with airway symptoms,
appropriate hand washing, and enhanced standard infection prevention, and control practices in the healthcare
setting.47,48

Uncertain issues
Although information on COVID-19 has increased rapidly
since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, many issues remain
unresolved. First, the clinical manifestation of COVID-19
ranges from the asymptomatic carrier state to severe
pneumonia; however, most early reports only showed the
findings of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, in which the ratio of
male patients was much larger than that of female patients, there were no pediatric cases, and the mortality
rate was high.12e14 Subsequent to the publication of the
studies of patients with only ARD or mild pneumonia, we
found the ratio of male-to-female patients decreased,
children or neonates could contract COVID-19, and the
mortality rate declined compared to that of previous reports.8,11 However, whether children were less susceptible
to SARS-CoV-2, or their presentation was mostly asymptomatic or difficult to detect, remains unclear.49 In addition, most studies, especially those with a large patient
population, were conducted in China, and the study of
asymptomatic carriers was limited. More studies are
needed to clarify the epidemiologic characteristics of
COVID-19 and to identify the risk and prognostic factors of
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Second, Zou et al. reported that the viral load detected in asymptomatic patients was similar to that found in symptomatic patients;
however, the viral loads from patients with severe diseases
were higher than those in patients with mild-to-moderate
presentations. Moreover, higher viral loads were detected
in the nose than in the throat.50 As there is a concern of
virus spread due to severe cough induced by performing a
throat swab, nasal swab may be a relatively safe and sensitive alternative to collect the respiratory specimen of
patients with COVID-19. However, this study involved a
population of only 18 patients, including one asymptomatic
patient.49 In addition, every test has its own limitation and
sensitivity/specificity; however, the studies investigating
the performance of current diagnostic methods of SARSCoV-2 among different COVID-19 populations, including
asymptomatic carriers, ARD, and pneumonia, are lacking.
The false positive and negative rates of each diagnostic tool
among patients with COVID-19 presenting varying degrees
of severity of the disease remain unknown. This type of
information is important for screening patients with COVID19 and to aid isolation and infection control strategies.
Finally, since SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the

C.-C. Lai et al.
asymptomatic individual, the prophylactic or pre-emptive
use of effective anti-viral agents to reduce the viral load
and decrease the risk of virus spread from asymptomatic
carriers may help to control the spread of COVID-19.

Conclusion
This review provides updated information about COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 can affect patients of all ages. COVID-19 can
present as asymptomatic carriage, ARD, and pneumonia.
Severe cases are more likely to be older and to have
increased underlying comorbidities compared to mild
cases. Age and disease severity can be correlated with the
outcomes of COVID-19. To date, effective treatment for
SARS-CoV-2 is lacking; however, two trials investigating the
clinical efficacy of remdesivir are underway in China.
Currently, effective infection control intervention is the
only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
