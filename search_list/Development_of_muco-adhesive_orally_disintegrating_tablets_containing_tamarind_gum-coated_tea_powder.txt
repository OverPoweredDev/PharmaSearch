The aim of this study was to design and evaluate muco-adhesive orally disintegrating tablets manufactured by
microwave irradiation and containing polysaccharide. We prepared orally disintegrating tea tablets (ODTTs)
containing a 1 w/w% mass fraction of one of ﬁve polysaccharides (gum arabic, carrageenan, guar gum, tamarind
gum, or pectin) and evaluated the swelling degree, tablet hardness, friability, disintegration time, and adhesive
properties. All tablets had a swelling degree of about 1 mm, a hardness of over 13 N, and a friability degree
of < 1%. Tablets containing gum arabic and tamarind gum had disintegration times of 30 s or less and satisﬁed
requirements as orally disintegrating tablets. This could be attributed to their high void contents, which allowed
for water penetration. The adhesive properties and particle retention ratios were highest in ODTTs containing
tamarind gum, which was thought to be caused by the rapid disintegration and high viscosity of the tamarind
gum itself. When we investigated changing the mass fraction of tamarind gum, we found 1 w/w% was most
suitable for rapid disintegration and high adhesiveness. The ODTTs containing 1 w/w% tamarind gum showed
signiﬁcant growth inhibition towards Streptococcus mutans. Therefore, microwave irradiation technology and
addition of tamarind gum could be used to manufacture muco-adhesive orally disintegrating tablets for oral care.

1. Introduction
In the modern era, the pneumonia death rate has been increasing
with population aging and super-aging societies (Miyashita and
Yamauchi, 2018). Over 90% of pneumonia deaths are of older adults
aged 65 years or older, and about 70% of older adults suﬀering from
pneumonia have aspiration pneumonia (Teramoto et al., 2008; Baine
et al., 2001). Aspiration pneumonia is caused by bacteria or other
contaminants that enter the trachea because of decreased swallowing
function (i.e., deglutition reﬂex and cough reﬂex) (Manabe et al.,
2015), which is common in the older adult (Ebihara et al., 2016; Perry
et al., 2001; Li et al., 2015). Therefore, it is important to keep the oral
cavities of older adults clean to prevent aspiration pneumonia. In addition, eﬀective oral care can prevent intraoral diseases (e.g., periodontal disease and dental caries) and systemic diseases such as angina,
brain infarction, and diabetes that can be induced by intraoral disease.
Oral care preparations can improve quality of life for older adults

(Langmore et al., 1998; Teramoto et al., 2015), especially if the preparations are easily handled and can be taken even by bedridden patients.
Methods used for oral care include tooth brushing, mouthwashes,
and oral care supplements to control plaque derived from bacteria. In
dental caries, some Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) produce insoluble
glucan, which various microorganisms adhere to and then generate acid
and dissolve the tooth enamel (Leme et al., 2006; Forssten et al., 2010).
To prevent dental caries, chlorhexidine has been used to decrease
plaque accumulation (Charles et al., 2004). However, some side eﬀects,
such as tooth coloration, tartar formation in gingival crevices, and taste
disorders, have been reported when it is used for more than 2 weeks.
Consequently, it is best avoid long-term use of chlorhexidine where
possible (James et al., 2017). As other candidates, polyphenols such as
tannins, catechin, quercetin, and anthocyanin, which are biological
components of certain plants and very safe, have been reported to inhibit the formation of glucosyltransferase and bioﬁlms involved in the

carrageenan, guar gum, tamarind gum, and pectin). We determined the
eﬀects of these polysaccharides on the muco-adhesive properties of the
tablets for potential use as oral care preparations.

production of insoluble glucan (Ferrazzano et al., 2009; Percival et al.,
2006; Yamanaka-Okada et al., 2008). Polyphenols have not only antibacterial activity but also antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory activities
(Almajano et al., 2008; Jalil and Ismail, 2008; Cavet et al., 2011). In
diseases in the oral cavity such as dental caries and periodontal disease,
inﬂammation occurs as a host immune response towards bacteria. The
use of polyphenols with antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory activities
can reduce inﬂammation caused by oral bacteria and keep the inside of
the mouth clean. Tea leaves contain many compounds with antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inﬂammatory activities, and are a
candidate for preparation of oral care products (Graham, 1992).
We recently developed a novel method for facile preparation of
orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) by microwave irradiation of wetmolded tablets containing mannitol, sugar alcohol, a polymeric disintegrant, and water absorbent materials (Sano et al., 2011; Sano et al.,
2013; Sano et al., 2014). ODTs are designed to dissolve in a small
amount of water in the oral cavity to enable patients with dysphagia or
restricted water intake to swallow tablets. They represent one of the
most patient-friendly dosage forms (Wade et al., 2012; Pﬁster and
Ghosh, 2005). In our methodology, the microwave irradiation led to the
formation of water vapor, which resulted in the expansion of the pores
inside the tablets and the formation of new void networks. These new
void networks allowed for the water to penetrate into the tablet more
eﬃciently and resulted in a decrease in their disintegration time. In
addition, the formation of water vapor during the microwave irradiation also led to the dissolution/precipitation of some of the mannitol
particles, which resulted in the formation of new solid bridges. The
formation of new solid bridges between the mannitol particles led to an
increase in the hardness of the tablets. Taken together, this new method
therefore makes it possible to prepare ODTs with opposing physicochemical properties such as rapid disintegration time and enhanced
hardness. In addition, we developed orally disintegrating tea tablets
(ODTTs) containing powdered tea leaves. These ODTTs disintegrated
within the oral cavity within 30 s (Tanaka et al., 2016). In a preliminary
evaluation of antibacterial activity against S. mutans, an ODTT extract
greatly inhibited bacterial growth compared with artiﬁcial saliva. As
the disintegrated particles are kept in the oral cavity for a long time, the
antimicrobial action is sustained, and this should increase the therapeutic eﬀect for oral care. If we could give ODTTs muco-adhesive
properties, the powdered tea that disintegrates in the oral cavity would
adhere to the oral mucosa and exhibit sustained antibacterial action
against oral microbial ﬂora and provide eﬃcient oral care (Fig. 1).
In the present study, we tried to make muco-adhesive orally disintegrating tea tablets by adding polysaccharides. Polysaccharides contain many connected monosaccharides and have diﬀerent types of
bonding and molecular weights (Wüstenberg, 2015). Polysaccharides
contain hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, and their thickening or gelling
action is determined by the type and concentration of these groups
(Dickinson, 2003). They are used in a wide range of applications in
foods, cosmetics, oral care products, and medicines (Avachat et al.,
2011; Nayak et al., 2014; Datta and Bandyopadhyay, 2006). Mucin, the
main component of oral mucosa, reportedly strengthens interactions
with hydrogen bond donors in the solute, and polysaccharides containing many hydroxyl and carboxyl groups interact with mucin (Caron
et al., 2015). This allows powdered tea to attach to the oral cavity via
polysaccharides. Because we used microwave irradiation to prepare the

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Oolong tea leaves (Utonrousousuisen) were purchased from the
Banboo Cakan Chinese tea ceremony (Kochi, Japan). D(−)-Mannitol
was purchased in its β crystalline form from Merck Ltd (Tokyo, Japan).
Low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose (L-HPC) (mean particle size,
45 µm; hydroxyepoxy group, NBD-020) was supplied by Shin-etsu
Chemical Co., Ltd (Tokyo, Japan). Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)
(Kollidon® 25) was obtained from BASF Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Gum
arabic (Gum arabic HP powder), carrageenan (Sheepy gum® FA), guar
gum (Guar pack® PF-20), tamarind gum (Glyroid® 6C), and pectin (H&F
pectin classic AF701) were purchased from DSP Gokyo Food and
Chemical (Osaka, Japan). Yeast nitrogen base without amino acids was
purchased from Nippon Becton Dickinson Co., Ltd (Tokyo, Japan).
Glucose, ammonium sulfate, polypeptone S, and monopotassium
phosphate were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd
(Osaka, Japan). Brain heart infusion was purchased from Nissui
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). All other reagents used were
of the highest grade available from commercial sources.
2.2. Design of muco-adhesive tablet formulations containing
polysaccharide-coated tea powders
2.2.1. Formulation of ODTTs containing polysaccharides
ODTTs were prepared using an established method with a slight
modiﬁcation (Tanaka et al., 2016). Oolong tea leaves were ground
using a standard tea grinder (Teaﬁne Mutow, Shizuoka, Japan). The
resulting powder was sieved through a 75-µm screen and 32 w/w% of
the powdered tea was placed in a mortar. A 1.68 M Na2HPO4 aqueous
solution (40 w/w% mass fraction of the powdered tea mass) for use as
an adsorption solvent was then dropped into the mortar using a pipette,
and the resulting mixture was stirred using a pestle to obtain a homogenous mixture. Polysaccharide (1 w/w% mass fraction of the total
mass of mixed powder) was added and it adsorbed onto and coated the
powdered tea surface. The ODTT formulations are summarized in
Table 1. D-Mannitol (55 w/w% or 56 w/w%), L-HPC (10 w/w%), and
PVP (2 w/w%) were then added, and the resulting mixture was blended
with the pestle. An additional portion of distilled water (45 w/w% mass
fraction of the total mass of mixed powder) was then added to the
mortar as a granulation solvent, and the resulting mixture was granulated for approximately 1 min. A portion (60 mg) of the wet granules
was compressed using a compression test apparatus (MPC-100, Okada
Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) ﬁtted with several punches (ø 5 mm). Considering
the further development of tablets which are easily handled and can be
taken even by bedridden patients, smaller sized tablet (ø 5 mm) was
selected. A compression force of 0.43 kN was used for tablet preparation. The wet molded tablets were heated in a microwave oven (NEEH226, Panasonic, Osaka, Japan) at 500 W, which gave a reaction
temperature of 140 °C. After microwave treatment, the tablets were

were repeated three times and the average values were calculated.

2.3.4. Disintegration time
The disintegration time was measured using an ODT tester (ODmate, Imotoseisakusyo, Kyoto, Japan). The bottom surface on which the
tablets were placed was 4 mm mesh. The tablet was placed in the center
of the mesh, and the tester loading tool was placed on the top of the
tablet. An aliquot (10 mL) of artiﬁcial saliva, which contained distilled
water (1 L), NaCl (1.44 g), KCl (1.47 g), and Tween 80 (3 g) and was at
37 °C, was placed in a beaker and stirred at 1000 rpm. The tablet
sandwiched between the loading tool and the bottom surface was
lowered in the beaker to the predetermined position. The disintegration
time was recorded as the period between when the tester arm was
lowered to the predetermined position and when the loading tool touched the bottom of the mesh. The start and end points of each measurement were recorded by a photo microsensor. The maximum disintegration time for these experiments was set to 120 s. All of the
measurements were repeated three times and the average values were
calculated.

dried in a thermostatic chamber at 80 °C for 24 h.
2.2.2. Formulation of ODTTs with various tamarind gum mass fractions
We formulated ODTTs with various tamarind gum mass fractions
(Table 2). The mass fractions of powdered tea, L-HPC, and PVP did not
change; therefore, 32 w/w% of the powdered tea, 10 w/w% of L-HPC
and 2 w/w% of PVP were used. The preparation method was similar to
that described in Section 2.2.1.

2.3.5. Adhesive property of the tablets
The adhesive properties of the tablets were measured using a tabletype tensile compression testing machine (Force Tester MCT-2150, A&D
Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) (Ikeuchi-Takahashi et al., 2013). The tablet to
be analyzed was ﬁxed with double-sided tape to the movable adapter.
Then, a mucin layer (10 w/v%) was prepared to the ﬁxed adapter.
Artiﬁcial saliva (50 μL) was placed on the mucin layer, and the movable
adapter with tablet was placed in contact with the mucin layer. After
conﬁrming that the tablet was in contact with the artiﬁcial saliva and
mucin layer and maintaining for 20 s, the movable adapter was raised
(Supplemental Fig. 1A). The load at that time was measured and the
adhesiveness was calculated from the load and the tablet area using Eq.
(2). All of these measurements were repeated three times and the
average values were calculated.

2.3. Characterization of ODTTs
2.3.1. Swelling degree
The degree of swelling was calculation according to Eq. (1).

Swelling degree = Thickness Treated − ThicknessUntreated ,

where ThicknessTreated and ThicknessUntreated are the thickness of the
microwave -treated and untreated tablets, respectively. The thickness of
each tablet was measured with a micrometer with a precision of
0.01 mm (CD-20, Mitsutoyo Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan). Three tablets were randomly selected for thickness measurements and the
average values were used for subsequent calculations.

Adhesiveness =

2.3.3. Friability
The tablet friability was determined using a tablet friability tester
(Friabilator, Toyama Sangyo, Osaka, Japan) in accordance with the
procedure described in the seventeenth edition of the Japanese
Pharmacopoeia (Osei-Yeboah and Sun, 2015). All the measurements

2.3.6. Particle retention ratio
Each tablet was pulverized with a mortar and pestle, and 100 mg of
the pulverized powders which have same particle size and particle size
distribution analyzed by a laser diﬀraction particle size analyzer
(Mastersizer2000; Marvern, Worcestershire, UK)(data not shown), was
suspended in 1 mL of artiﬁcial saliva. For analysis, a mucin layer (10 w/
v%) was prepared on a glass slide. The glass slide was inclined at 15°
and the suspension was dropped on it at a rate of 1 mL/min
(Supplemental Fig. 1B). The weights of the suspension before and after
the test were used to calculate particle retention ratio on the mucin
layer (Eq. (3)). All of these measurements were repeated three times
and the average values were calculated.

2.3.2. Tablet hardness
The tablet fracture strength was deﬁned as the force required to
break the tablet by radial compression. The tablet hardness was determined using a tablet hardness tester (PC30, Okada Seiko, Tokyo,
Japan). All of these measurements were repeated three times and the
average values were calculated.

gallate (EGCG). A mixture of methanol (solvent A) and puriﬁed water
(solvent B), which was deaerated ultrasonically for more than 10 min in
advance, was used as the mobile phase with a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL/min.
Quantiﬁcation was carried out on TSK ODS-80TM (150 mm × 4.6 mm,
5 µm). The column temperature was 40 °C and the sample volume was
5 µL. The detector was set at 280 nm. For the elution program, the
proportion of solvent A was increased from 10% to 50% from 0 to
30 min.
In addition, to completely elute the EGCG from the oolong tea
leaves, further incubation (100 rpm, 1 h) was performed after dissolution test and the total amount of EGCG was determined. The ratio of
EGCG released into the medium (%) was quantitatively obtained by
dividing by the total amount of EGCG.

measurements were repeated three times and the average values were
calculated.
2.3.9. Dissolution of epigallocatechin gallate
A dissolution test was performed for polysaccharide-free tablets
without microwave (F1-without microwave), ODTTs with microwave
(F1), tablets containing 1 w/w% tamarind gum without microwave (F5without microwave), and ODTTs containing 1 w/w% (mass fraction)
tamarind gum with microwave (F5) using the paddle apparatus. Each
test was performed by placing 10 tablets in each vessel, which was ﬁlled
with 150 mL of pH 6.8 phosphate buﬀer solution and kept at
37 ± 0.5 °C. The paddle speed was adjusted to 50 rpm. Samples were
taken after 5, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h. The samples were
ﬁltered through a ﬁlter with a pore size of 0.20 µm and then applied for
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (LC-2010CHT,

of the resulting mixture was adjusted to 7.1 with a sodium hydroxide
solution. This mixture was used as the catechin medium. The catechin
medium (8 mL), test solution (1 mL), and S. mutans (270 µL) were cultured for 24 h in brain heart infusion in a boiling tube. Thereafter,
cultivation was carried out at 37 °C. The turbidity at 651.5 nm was
measured at 0, 3, 5, and 7 h using a spectrophotometer (UV-mini-1240,
Shimadzu Co.) and used for determination of growth inhibition. The
sample containing artiﬁcial saliva was designated as the control for
comparison purposes. All of these measurements were repeated three
times and the average values were calculated.

1 w/w% tamarind gum without microwave (F5-without microwave),
and Five ODTTs containing 1 w/w% tamarind gum with microwave
(F5) were incubated in separate 10-mL aliquots of artiﬁcial saliva for
1 h at 37 °C. After 10 min of sonication, centrifugation was performed
for 20 min. Each supernatant was ﬁltered through a 0.20-μm sterilizing
ﬁlter to prepare a test solution.

Quantiﬁcation of catechins (epicatechin gallate (ECG), gallocatechin gallate (GCG), epigallocatechin (EGC), and EGCG) in the prepared tablets was carried out by HPLC (LC-2010CHT) in the same
manner described in Section 2.3.9.

All date were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. In tablets properties, the statistical signiﬁcance of diﬀerences between
ODTTs with microwave (F1) and ODTTs with each polysaccharide, as
well as between ODTTs containing 1 w/w% tamarind gum with microwave (F5) and ODTTs containing 0.5, 3 and 5 w/w% tamarind gum
with microwave was determined using ANOVA. P-values < 0.05 were
considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.

3. Results and discussion

gum had higher viscosities than other polysaccharides at 25 °C. We
assumed that this was caused by aggregation of polysaccharide molecules by dehydration of saccharides and alcohols, and by formation of
higher-order networks by hydrogen bonding of saccharides and alcohols with polysaccharide molecules. From these results, we considered
that artiﬁcial saliva rapidly inﬁltrated into F5 in the 20 s and the tamarind gum dissolved. The adhesiveness was high in this case because
tamarind gum strongly bound to mucin via hydrogen bonding. Guar
gum also had a high viscosity like tamarind gum, but the adhesiveness
of the tablet containing guar gum was not as high as that of F5. We
considered that this diﬀerence was caused by the permeability of the
ODTTs. A small air gap was observed in F4 and it had a disintegration
time of 120 s (Fig. 3), so the permeability to F4 appeared to be lower
than that of F5. Therefore, despite the high viscosity, the amount of
guar gum dissolved was small and the adhesiveness of F4 was lower
than that of F5. For the particle retention ratio, although bonding between the pulverized tablet particles and the mucin layer was relatively
high (Fig. 2F), F4 had a disintegration time of 120 s or more.
In summary, although there were no diﬀerences in the swelling
degree, hardness, and friability among the formulations, F2 and F5
quickly disintegrated within 30 s and F5 had high adhesiveness properties and a high particle retention ratio.

3.1. Evaluation of ODTTs containing polysaccharides (1 w/w% mass
fraction)
The degree of swelling, hardness, friability, disintegration time,
adhesiveness, and particle retention ratio results are shown in Fig. 2.
The degree of swelling did not diﬀer between formulations, and all
formulations swelled by about 1 mm (Fig. 2A). This suggests that when
the wet tablet was microwave irradiated, water vapor inside the tablet
evaporated, and the tablet swelled. Suﬃcient swelling should shorten
the disintegration time. The results of our previous study showed that
swelling of over 0.2 mm was suﬃcient for shortening the disintegration
time of ODTs (Sano et al., 2011). All formulations had hardness values
of over 13 N (Fig. 2B), which is suﬃcient hardness for a 5-mm diameter
tablet (Tanaka et al., 2016). This is because the excipient D-mannitol
melts at 168 °C and forms strong particle-to-particle bonds during microwave irradiation. In addition, because of the high hardness, the
friability was < 1% in all formulations (Fig. 2C). However, the disintegration times were more than 120 s for F3, F4 and F6, which contained carrageenan, guar gum, and pectin, respectively (Fig. 2D). By
comparison, F1 and F2, which contained gum arabic, and F5, which
contained with tamarind gum, had disintegration times of < 30 s. According to the Food and Drug Administration, ODTs should disintegrate
within 30 s (FDA, 2008). The disintegration times of F1, F2, and F5
satisﬁed this requirement.
We also observed the surfaces of the tablets by SEM (Fig. 3). Many
small voids (diameter: over 3 μm) were observed in F1, F2, and F5,
whereas few voids were observed in F3, F4, and F6. Generally, as the
number of voids increases, the water permeation to the interior of the
tablet increases and the disintegration time decreases (Kondo et al.,
2012). By contrast, as the number of voids decreases, the water permeation decreases and the disintegration time increases. Therefore, the
disintegration times indicate that F1, F2, and F5 have many voids and
good water permeation.
Among the tablets, F5 showed the highest adhesiveness with the
mucin layer (Fig. 2E and F). The high adhesiveness of tamarind gum
might be caused by its viscosity. We measured the viscosities of the
polysaccharides at 25 °C and 80 °C (Fig. 4). Guar gum and tamarind

3.2. Eﬀect of the tamarind gum concentration on physicochemical
properties of the ODTTs
Our results showed that ODTTs containing tamarind gum had good
hardness, rapid disintegration, and high adhesiveness. Therefore, we
investigated the eﬀect of the tamarind gum mass fraction on physicochemical properties of the ODTTs. We measured the degree of swelling,
hardness, friability, disintegration time, adhesiveness, and particle retention ratio for tablets with tamarind gum mass fractions of 0.5, 1, 3,
and 5 w/w% (Fig. 5). For ODTTs with tamarind gum mass fractions of
0.5 and 1 w/w%, the degree of swelling was about 1 mm, but as the
tamarind gum mass fraction increased to 3 and 5 w/w%, the degree of
swelling decreased to about 0.5 mm (Fig. 5A). This is because a gel was
formed in the tablet as the proportion of tamarind gum increased, and
even though microwave irradiation was carried out, the water vapor
could not suﬃciently expand the tablet. The hardness values were over
13 N in all formulations (Fig. 5B). Because of the high hardness, all
formulations had friability values of < 1% (Fig. 5C), which suggests
that the hardness is enough. When the tamarind gum mass fraction was
0.5 or 1 w/w%, the disintegration time was < 30 s (Fig. 5D); however,
as the tamarind gum mass fraction increased, the disintegration time
increased to > 60 s.
When we observed the tablet surfaces by SEM, many voids were
observed in ODTTs containing 0.5 and 1 w/w% (mass fraction) tamarind gum, whereas hardly any voids were observed in ODTTs containing 3 and 5 w/w% (mass fraction) tamarind gum (Fig. 6). As discussed above, with an increase in the viscosity of tamarind gum, the
surface voids would disappear. This indicates that the lack of voids
prevents water permeation into the tablet and extends the disintegration time.
The adhesive properties of the tablets increased as the mass fraction
of tamarind gum increased (Fig. 5E). Because of the increase in the
tamarind gum mass fraction, the viscosity increased and the bond with
the mucin layer became stronger. This increased the load and the adhesiveness increased. In addition, as the mass fraction of tamarind gum
increased, the particle retention ratio increased (Fig. 5F). It is thought
that as the content of tamarind gum bonded to the mucin layer increased, the adhesiveness increased. Therefore, although an increase in
the mass fraction of tamarind gum tended to enhance the adhesiveness
of the tablet, addition of 1 w/w% tamarind gum produced tablets with
suﬃcient hardness, disintegration, and adhesiveness.

microwave -treated tablets (F1 and F5) showed rapid dissolution
compared with tablets prepared without microwave. This was because
the powdered tea became friable at the high temperature induced by
microwave irradiation, and this increased the EGCG dissolution.

3.3. Evaluation of the dissolution behavior of EGCG
We studied the dissolution behavior of EGCG, which is an active
compound in tea leaves (Fig. 7). We examined its dissolution using
ODTTs containing 1 w/w% (mass fraction) tamarind gum and prepared
with microwave (F5). These tablets showed rapid disintegration and
high adhesiveness. In addition, we carried out a dissolution test with
polysaccharide-free tablets without microwave (F1-without microwave), ODTTs with microwave (F1), and tablets containing 1 w/w%
(mass fraction) tamarind gum without microwave (F5-without microwave). F1 showed the highest dissolution rate until 30 min, and after
1 h, all tablets showed dissolution rates of almost 90%. Compared with
F1 and F5, even with the addition of tamarind gum, F5 showed a dissolution rate of 90% or more after 1 h. Therefore, addition of tamarind
gum hardly aﬀected the dissolution rate of EGCG. In addition,

3.4. Quantitative analysis of catechin
In addition to the dissolution study of EGCG, we extracted other
active compounds from the tablets and performed quantitative analyses
for further antibacterial studies. The quantitative values for all compounds (ECG, GCG, EGC, and EGCG) (Table 3) were lower after microwave treatment than before. This indicates that they were likely
converted to other compounds by microwave irradiation or decomposed. However, even when tamarind gum was added, fast dissolution
was observed compared with the tablet without tamarind gum. This

higher absorbance value means S. mutans is proliferating, whereas a
lower absorbance value means that growth of S. mutans is suppressed.
The absorbance of the control gradually increased with time and
marked proliferation of S. mutans was observed. In all formulations, the
absorbances were markedly low and little bacterial growth was observed, indicating that all formulations had growth inhibitory eﬀects.
From the results of dissolution tests, we found EGCG had a dissolution
rate of 90% or more at 1 h (Fig. 7). Therefore, although the amounts of
the active compound in F1 and F5 were a little bit lower than those in
tablets prepared without microwave irradiation, suﬃcient EGCG was
present to show antibacterial activity. Overall, the slight diﬀerences of
total amounts of EGCG did not aﬀect the antibacterial properties. Previously, EGCG have been reported to inhibit the formation of glucosyltransferases and bioﬁlms at 500 µg/mL (Koo et al., 2002), which is
similar to our results. We can conclude that polyphenols extracted from
tea leaves seems show signiﬁcant growth inhibitory eﬀects.

4. Conclusions
We used polysaccharides to prepare ODTTs with adhesive properties
for use as novel oral care preparations. The prepared ODTTs had a
swelling degree of about 1 mm, hardness of 13 N or more, and friability
of 1% or less. Among the ODTTs, those containing tamarind gum disintegrated in 30 s or less because there were many voids on the tablet
surface for water to penetrate. The adhesive properties and particle
retention ratios were also highest in the ODTTs containing tamarind
gum, which could be attributed to the rapid disintegration and high
viscosity of the tamarind gum itself. When we increased the tamarind
gum mass fraction in the formulation, the swelling degree decreased to
about 0.5 mm and the disintegration time increased. This is because the
thickening action of the gum increases as its mass fraction increases,
and the tablet surface is covered by a gel. This prevents void and suppresses water penetration. Although the adhesive properties and particle retention ratios increased as the mass fraction of tamarind gum
increased, the disintegration time was adversely aﬀected. Therefore,
among the mass fractions we studied, 1 w/w% tamarind gum is best for
preparation of ODTTs. In our dissolution tests, even with the addition of
tamarind gum, the dissolution rate was 90% or more after 1 h, indicating that addition of tamarind gum hardly aﬀected the dissolution
rate of EGCG. When we evaluated the antimicrobial activities of ODTTs
with/without 1 w/w% tamarind gum, we observed growth inhibition
against S. mutans with all formulations. In summary, ODTTs containing
1 w/w% tamarind gum have suﬃcient hardness, disintegration, adhesiveness, and antibacterial activity. Especially, Du et al., demonstrated
that the dental adhesives containing 200 or 300 μg/mL EGCG were
found to exhibit inhibitory eﬀect on the growth of S. mutans (Du et al.,
2012), speculating that polyphenols extracted from ODTTs with mucoadhesive property might show signiﬁcant growth inhibitory eﬀects in
vivo. Future studies using animal models with periodontal disease are
needed to determine whether the ODTTs with tamarind gum work as
expected in the oral cavity. If they do, they could be used for selfmedication to contribute to the health of many people.
