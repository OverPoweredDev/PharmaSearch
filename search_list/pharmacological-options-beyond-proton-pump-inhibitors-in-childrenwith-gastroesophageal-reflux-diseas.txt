Abstract
Pharmacological treatment of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) disease is mostly based on acid control. However,
different molecules have been proposed both for patients with persisting symptoms and to limit adverse effects of
proton pump inhibitors (PPI). This paper focuses on other acid inhibitors, alginate, prokinetics, drug acting on lower
esophageal sphincter and esophageal hypersensitivity. Mechanism of action, indications, efficacy, limits and recent
advances are reported. Pediatric data and possible adverse effects are also considered.

Introduction
Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are the treatment of choice both for
children and adolescents with heartburn, reflux esophagitis,
pathological acid exposure or significant association with symptoms
related to acid gastroesophageal reflux (GER) detected by (impedance)
pH-monitoring [1]. Persisting symptoms on PPI may be related to
several factors such as: insufficient drug dosage (e.g., in neurological
patients), incorrect intake (e.g., not before the first meal of the day),
major effect of the non-acid component (or currently classified as
weakly acid reflux with pH>4) or of the volume of reflux (esophageal
distention) in the generation of symptoms, esophageal hypersensitivity,
primary motor disorders or other diagnosis (non GER disorder).
The pathogenesis of GER disease (GERD) is complex and include
several contributing factors such as inappropriate lower esophageal
sphincter (LES) relaxations, abnormal esophageal motility and
clearance, delayed gastric emptying, increased both acid and non-acid
GER, impaired esophageal resistance and esophageal hypersensitivity.
Physiologic GER and infantile regurgitation do not need medical
treatment although they frequently cause parental distress and
anxiousness [1]. Management in these patients should be based on
parental education and reassurance, dietary and, eventually, positional
treatment.

Pharmacological therapy used to treat GERD encompass
antisecretory agents, antacids, surface barrier agents, prokinetics,
agents reducing LES relaxations and, more recently in adult patients,
anti-depressant drugs. From the pathophysiologic point of view,
prokinetic drugs are the most logic therapeutic approach to treat
GERD because they improve the motility of both esophagus and
stomach, reducing the time of the esophageal contact with refluxate
and accelerating gastric emptying. However, there is no effective and
safe prokinetic agent on the market.
Appropriate treatment of GERD is important to reduce GER related
symptoms and possible esophageal (e.g., esophagitis) and extraesophageal (e.g., respiratory manifestations, sleeping or feeding
disturbances) complications and to improve quality of life of the
patients.
This article focuses on current therapeutic pharmacological options
beyond PPI in GERD and updates the current pediatric data of other
acid-inhibitors, “barrier agents”, prokinetics, and drugs that act on the
inferior esophageal sphincter or on the “symptomatic sensitivity”
(Table 1). Neither non-pharmacological therapies (e.g., postural,
dietetic ones) nor endoscopic and surgical treatments will be herein
discussed.

Other acid-inhibitors except PPI
Ranitidine is often (too much) administered, especially in infants,
on clinical basis without a proven diagnosis of GERD. The preference
towards ranitidine compared to PPI is mostly related to its availability
as a syrup and off-label use of PPI in the first year of life. Ranitidine (at
an oral dose of 5-10 mg/kg/die divided in 2-3 doses) suppresses the
gastric acid secretion less (partially) and for a shorter period (about
4-8 hours) of time compared to PPI, and is often associated with
tachyphylaxis, which cannot be solved with an increase of the dosage.
In 2006 Pfefferkorn evaluated the possible benefit of ranitidine (4
mg/kg), as add-on therapy to PPI, to cover the night-time acid
secretion (nocturnal acid breakthrough) in children with reflux
esophagitis. There was no evidence of any decrease in the symptomatic
score, in the acid exposure detected by pH-monitoring or in the
esophageal mucosal lesions compared to placebo [2].

Table 1: Pharmacological therapy of GERD beyond acid-inhibitors:
molecules and mechanisms
A systematic review analysing 8 studies (276 children treated) have
recently reported a limited evidence of effectiveness and safety in
pediatric age and a lack of good quality data. Conversely, adverse
effects similar to PPI have been shown, including increased infections,
variation of the intestinal microbiota and an increased risk of
necrotizing enterocolitis in premature babies [3].
Cimetidine has seldom been used as acid-inhibitor in children and
is not recommended for its side effects on cytochrome P450, on the
metabolism of vitamin D and on the endocrine function.
Other drugs have been proposed for adult patients with GERD, e.g.,
Vonoprazan (a new acid-inhibitor acting on potassium, PCABs),
which seems to have a stronger and more lasting effect of acid
suppression compared to PPI [4,5].
Current available information about antacids (based on potassium/
sodium bicarbonate, aluminum and magnesium hydroxide or calcium
salts) in children with GERD are too limited to recommend their use
and concern about the prolonged use of aluminum has been raised,
especially in young children and in patients affected by kidney diseases
[1].

Alginate
Alginate is a polysaccharide derived from brown seaweed and it can
absorb water or react with gastric enzymes like pepsin, thus increasing
the viscosity of the gastric content.
Alginate based drugs can act on GERD both physically, through a
mechanic effect in the stomach and chemically, reducing acid content.
Alginate precipitates in an acidic environment and quickly creates, a
few minutes after administration, a viscous gel or “rafting” in the upper
part of the stomach, thus reducing reflux. Besides, some commercial
alginate compounds may decrease acid GER because of the
concomitant presenceof antacids (e.g., bicarbonate, with a “foam” effect
over gel and gastric content) thus reducing the “backwash” of the acid
pocket located in the gastric fundus. However, alginate is not currently
recommended for the treatment of esophagitis for less evidence of
efficacy compared to ranitidine and PPI, but only for heartburn in
older children and for regurgitations associated to other distressing
symptoms in infants [6,7].
In 2000 a review evaluated the effect of alginate based specific
formulations (Gaviscon and Gaviscon Infant) and included 6 pediatric
studies for a total amount of 303 treated children or infants. Only one
double-blind trial was available. The authors reported a significant
effect of alginate in reducing regurgitation/vomiting and heartburn, a
possible benefit on the pH-monitoring parameters (in one study with a
concurrent presence of thickening agents), and less effectiveness
compared to H2-antagonists in the treatment of esophagitis. Tolerance
was satisfactory in all patients and the only report assessing side effects
showed diarrhea or constipation in few patients, with a similar rate
compared to placebo [8]. A double-blind pediatric trial which enrolled
20 infants with random administration (3+3) of milk formula on/off
an alginate formulation (Gaviscon Infant) without antacids, showed a
decrease of all reflux parameters, assessed by impedance-pH
monitoring, with a significant effect of alginate only for the height
(esophageal extension) of reflux [9].
In 32 preterm newborns Corvaglia et al. confirmed a significant
reduction of proximal, gasseous, and acid reflux and of the acid
esophageal exposure after the 4 meals with alginate (Gaviscon 0.25
ml/kg/dose) compared with the other 4 drug-free meals [10]. Another
trial of the same year which have analysed only one postprandial
period with alginate, reported the decrease of acid GER without a
concurrent effect on the reflux related apneas in 28 preterm newborns.
No adverse effect occurred [11]. In 2015 a clinical study comparing 3
groups of infants showed a greater reduction of GER related symptoms
in the group (25 infants) treated for 2 months with a magnesium plus
simeticone alginate based formulation (Gastrotuss Baby) (2.5 to 5 mls
three times per day) compared to the other two groups (one treated
with a thickened milk formula and the other one with parental
reassurance). Only one infant reported constipation as a possible side
effect of the treatment [12].
Currently, the evidence of effectiveness of alginate in GER is limited
in the pediatric age, whereas it’s more validated in the adults.
Considering the lack of information, NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN
guidelines published in 2009 did not recommend alginate in GER(D)
treatment [1]. More recently, NICE guidelines have considered alginate
as first pharmacological approach in GER, with a 1-2 weeks trial (to
extend in case of benefit) in infants with severe reflux symptoms
(regurgitations and “marked distress”), persisting after parental
reassurance, postural treatment and diet changes [7]. It’s recommended
to use formulations without aluminum and to consider the sodium

content (variable according to the different commercial products) for a
prolonged use particularly in preterm newborns and in children with
kidney diseases.
The heterogeneity of age of the populations, of commercial alginate
formulations and outcomes, does not allow a proper meta-analysis of
the results.
In a trial recruiting 16 adults affected by GERD, an alginate-antacid
based product (Gaviscon Double Action Liquid) proved to be located
into the postprandial “acid pocket” (an upper stomach area not
buffered by meal) right under the diaphragm and close to LES, thus
reducing the postprandial acid reflux [13].

Prokinetics
From a pathogenetic point of view prokinetics should be one of the
most rational therapeutic approach in patients with GERD, especially
in case of non-acid reflux disease. Nevertheless, prokinetics are not
recommended as GERD treatment in infants and children because of
the limited evidence of efficacy and their known neurological and
cardiological adverse events.
No recent trials using erythromycin (a macrolide that promotes
peristalsis and gastric emptying binding to motilin receptors) or
metoclopramide (a molecule with an alfa sympathomimetic effect with
dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonism) as GERD treatment in
children are available. Moreover, metoclopramide should not be
administered because of its high rate of serious side effects like
lethargy, irritability, gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea and extrapyramidal
reactions with possible permanent dyskinesia.
Domperidone is a dopamine receptor antagonist (D2) with a gastric
prokinetic effect. A systematic review on domperidone published in
2005 identified only 4 controlled randomized trials in children and no
one of them showed a significant evidence of efficacy supporting its use
in pediatric GERD [14]. In 2008 Cresi et al. assessed the effect of
domperidone in 13 neonates with symptoms of GERD using
impedance-pH monitoring. The number of reflux episodes increased
although the duration of each GER events decreased [15].
Furthermore, domperidone may cause extrapyramidal effects, increase
of prolactin, unpredictable increase of QTc on ECG and serious
ventricular arrhythmias with possible sudden death [16].

myenteric plexus, of cellular bodies and of nerve fibers of the nodose
ganglion (except GABA(A) ones), in the dorsal motor and in the
solitary tract nuclei [18]. Pharmacological molecules which interact
with these receptors may thus determine a reduction of GER through a
peripheral action but may, concurrently, also cause central side effects.
Gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor agonist baclofen is often
used to reduce spasticity in neurological patients. Moreover, in adult
patients with GER baclofen reduced TLESRs of 40-60%, both acid and
nonacid (postprandial) GER and a symptomatic score, increased LES
basal pressure and accelerated gastric emptying [19]. Because of its
passage through the blood-brain barrier, several side effects have been
reported in patients treated with baclofen, such as headache, fatigue,
tiredness, drowsiness, lethargy, confusion, unsteadiness, dizziness,
hypotension, “memory lapses”, dyspnoea sensation, weakness, tremor
and reduction of seizure threshold.
A 1-week small trial in 8 neurologically impaired children with
GERD treated with baclofen showed a reduction in the number of acid
reflux episodes and in the frequency of emesis (in 6 children), whilst
the percentage of esophageal acid exposure (reflux index) didn’t
decrease and the esophageal clearance time increased (in 4 out of 8
patients) [20]. The efficacy of 0.5 mg/kg baclofen has been evaluated in
the only randomised, placebo controlled trial in 30 children affected by
resistant GERD. Measurement of esophageal motility and pH during
the 2 hours’ test period showed a significant reduction of the incidence
of TLESR and a significant acceleration of gastric emptying [21]. No
important adverse effect occurred during the first 48 hours post
treatment. More recently, a retrospective analysis including 53 children
with proven GERD or GERD related symptoms (such as heartburn,
regurgitation, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, dyspepsia, lack of
appetite, coughing, dental erosion) treated with 0.5 mg/kg/day (or 30
mg/die maximum) of baclofen in 3 divided doses showed a significant
reduction in symptoms in 2/3 (35) of patients at their first follow-up
evaluation and in 22 patients after 12 months, respectively. In 3
patients the treatment was stopped because of sleepiness [22].
Prospective studies are needed to validate these preliminary results
and assess baclefon safety.
Arbaclofen placarbil has only been studied in adults without
significant efficacy compared to placebo in reducing symptoms of
GERD [23,24].

No pediatric studies have been published so far and limited data are
available in adult patients treated for GERD with other prokinetic
molecules like mosapride, itopride, prucalopride, levosulpiride,
revexepride and renzapride, or motilin agonists [17].

In another trial in adult patients, Lesogaberan, another GABA-B
receptor agonist with a peripheral action, showed an important
reduction of both TLESR and of acid and postprandial non-acid reflux
[25].

Bethanechol, a choline carbamate with para sympathomimetic
action selectively stimulating muscarinic receptors as a cholinergic
agonist, showed a doubtful effectiveness and a high rate of side effects
in children affected by GERD [1].

Preliminary analysis in adults with GERD treated with mGluR5
selective receptor antagonists (AZD2066, ADX10059) reported a
reduction TLESRs and of acid reflux with adverse events like instability
(in 3 out of 13) and attention disorders (in 3 out of 13) or an increase
of liver enzymes [18].

Drugs acting on LES
Inappropriate (because not triggered by swallowing) transient LES
relaxations (TLESRs) are one of the most important mechanism in
reflux genesis at any age and are mediated by a vasovagal reflex
stimulated by gastric distention. This reflex can be blocked by an
interaction with 5 metabotropic Glutamate receptors (mGluR5), A and
B alfa-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA (A, B)) and cannabinoid
ones (CB 1,2). The above receptors recently proved to be widely
expressed (except GABA(A) receptors) in the neurons of LES

“Esophageal hypersensitivity” therapy and future perspective
In the last ten years, it has been clearly demonstrated that many
patients suffering from GERD present non-erosive reflux disease, that
both esophageal symptoms and mucosal injuries can occur with
nonacid GER (pH>4) and that several “sensory” receptors are located
in the esophagus and respond to different pH (transient receptor
potential vanilloid receptor (TRPV) type 1 and TPRV4 at pH<6, acidsensitive ion channels (ASIC) between pH 6 and 7 and p2X at pH<7).

However, the manifestation of pain, heartburn or other symptoms, are
dependent on many components (chemical, physical and mechanical
ones, related to pH, to volume and content of GER, or to esophageal
distention, clearance and mucosal defense) and, particularly, on the
individual threshold of perception of one or more stimuli.
Neither enough information nor current studies on mucosal
protective drugs, such as sucralfate, are available in pediatric patients
and they are not recommended by the current guidelines on GERD
treatment [1]. Sucralfate is a sucrose, sulphate and aluminium
compound that, in an acid environment, creates a gel binding to the
mucosa with peptic erosions. The only pediatric randomized
controlled study available was published in 1989 and proved that
sucralfate was as effective as cimetidine in the treatment of esophagitis
[26].
Serotonine selective re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been
proposed in adult patients with esophageal hypersensitivity (negative
endoscopy and acid exposure at pH-monitoring but positive symptom
association with GER in the (impedance)pH-monitoring) [27].
Analgesic drugs and low doses of tricyclic antidepressants have been
suggested in case of functional heartburn (symptoms of GER but
normal endoscopy and (impedance)pH-monitoring) [27].
Pain modulators like tricyclic antidepressants, trazodone,
serotonine-norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors or SSRIs can act as gut
analgesics both through central nervous system effects and/or sensory
nerve fibers afferents.
A systematic review has recently analysed the efficacy of
antidepressants in adults with GERD or esophageal functional
disorders with symptoms like heartburn or chest pain, dysphagia or
pharyngeal globus, caused by possible esophageal visceral hyperalgesia.
Overall 378 articles and 15 randomised controlled trials eligible for the
inclusion criteria were identified. After antidepressant therapy the
esophageal pain threshold raised from 7 to 37%, with a reduction of
pain from 18 to 67% and a reduction of heartburn, in patients with
GERD, from 23 to 61%, highlighting that antidepressants can ease
esophageal symptoms in a subgroup of patients with GERD [28].
Further controlled trials are needed to evaluate their effects on
esophageal functional disorders [28].
No study evaluates the prevalence of esophageal functional
disorders in children and analgesics or antidepressants effect in
pediatric patients with GERD.

Conclusion
As reported by a recent Cochrane review on pharmacological
treatment of children with GERD, analyzing 24 randomized controlled
trials, for an amount of 1201 children, there is no enough evidence of
the efficacy of prokinetics, there is some evidence of benefit using H2
antagonists, and there’s a moderate evidence of a specific alginate
formulation in improving infant’s symptoms [6]. Data about GABA
receptor agonists are still too limited and there are no pediatric data on
pain modulators or mucosal protective agents in patients with GERD.
Several adverse effects have been shown for all categories of drugs. A
proper diagnostic work-up and an adequate assessment of the safety
profile of the molecule are fundamental before starting any
pharmacological treatment in infants and children with only
symptoms or evidence of GERD.
