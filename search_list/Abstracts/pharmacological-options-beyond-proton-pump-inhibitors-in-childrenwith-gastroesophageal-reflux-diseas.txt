Pharmacological treatment of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) disease is mostly based on acid control. However,
different molecules have been proposed both for patients with persisting symptoms and to limit adverse effects of
proton pump inhibitors (PPI). This paper focuses on other acid inhibitors, alginate, prokinetics, drug acting on lower
esophageal sphincter and esophageal hypersensitivity. Mechanism of action, indications, efficacy, limits and recent
advances are reported. Pediatric data and possible adverse effects are also considered.
