Abstract
Background and purpose: Irregularities of angiogenesis may participate in the pathogenesis of diabetes
complications. Pramlintide is an amylin analogue administered for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
The present investigation aimed at surveying the effect of pramlintide on angiogenesis-related markers in
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
Experimental approach: The proliferation of cells was assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. The effect of pramlintide on migration was estimated by
Transwell® assay. in vitro evaluation of angiogenesis was performed by tube formation assay. The secretion
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to the supernatant of HUVECs was measured by an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
Findings / Results: Pramlintide exhibited no inhibitory effect on HUVECs proliferation. It significantly
increased cell migration at the concentration of 1 µg/mL. Pramlintide (1 µg/mL) also enhanced average tubules
length, size, and the mean number of junctions. However, there was not any significant change in VEGF release
from HUVECs.
Conclusion and implications: Findings of this research revealed the effect of pramlintide on angiogenesisrelated markers via enhancing migration and tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting a worthwhile proposition for
further clinical researches on improving vascular complications and healing of diabetic wounds.
