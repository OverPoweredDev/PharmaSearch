alCase (description): A case of a 57-year-old liver transplant patient with biliary drainage catheter whose recurrent
infection was managed by clinical pharmacists. The suggestions about the choice of antibiotic regimen and the
monitoring to other related infection factors, such as biliary drainage catheter and concentration of tracrolimus, were
accepted and used to the patient. The state of the infected patient was improved.
Conclusion: The antibioticsâ€™ distribution, antibacterial effect, and drug resistance could be taken into consideration
for the patients with recurrent infection after liver transplant. The resistance of antibiotics could be deferred by altering
suitable antibiotics. Close care to catheter and immunosuppressants could be necessary to prevent infection for the
patients after transplant.
