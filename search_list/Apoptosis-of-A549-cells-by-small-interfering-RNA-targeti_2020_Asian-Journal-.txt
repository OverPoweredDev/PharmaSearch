Introduction

According to the latest statistics, lung cancer leads the highest fatality among all cancer diseases [1]. Lung cancer is divided into non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell
lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC also has different types, such as
adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carci-

noma and so on. At present, the two common ways to treat
this disease is surgery and chemo-radiotherapy [2]. But these
approaches are expensive, painful and sometimes inefficient.
Gene therapy can bring patients with high therapeutic effects and low side effects when treating cancer diseases [3].
It refers to correcting or replacing a defective gene by introducing normal gene or therapeutic gene fragment into target
cells, and it has been extensively studied for treating primary

immunodeficiency [4], hemophilia [5], heart failure [6]. RNA
interference (RNAi) is a genetic surveillance mechanism that
permits the sequence-specific post transcriptional manipulation of gene expression in an accurate manner [7,8]. siRNAmediated cellular regulation by the RNAi-based pathway
could offer a new paradigm in anti-cancer [9]. The clinical
treatments show that delivery of gene to cancer cells recently face some obstacles for lack of suitable delivery vectors, proper therapeutic gene and feasible route of administration [10,11]. Hence, developing new delivery approaches is
urging.
Delivery vectors used for gene therapy include viral vectors and non-viral vectors [12]. Compared with viral vectors,
non-viral vectors show weaker immunogenicity and lower cytotoxicity, which have a wider application in gene therapy
[13]. Poly(β-amino ester) (PBAE) is a brand-new type of cationic
polymer material. PBAE is studied extensively for its biocompatibility and biodegradability [14]. To date, many research articles about PBAE focused on modifying polymers’ structure
or preparing ternary nanoparticles to improve the delivery efficiency of RNAi [15].
O-carboxymethyl chitosan (OCMCS) is a kind of amphiprotic ether derivative, which owns better physicochemical and
biological properties [16]. It has emerged as a promising biomaterial in various fields, and it has been proved that OCMCS
could significantly inhibit tumor cell migration in vitro [17].
However, there are still many challenges to address for its use
in gene delivery system. To improve transfection efficiency,
Park et al. modified OCMCS by grafting polyethylenimine [18].
Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) can promote cell uptake of
macromolecules because of the transmembrane transport
capacity of guanidine groups. The guanidine group can be
formed by the nucleophilic substitution reaction of primary
amino groups with isobutamic compound. Luo et al. reported
that guanidinylation of chitosan decreased cytotoxicity, facilitated cellular internalization and, at length enhanced the
gene silencing efficiency [19]. In our previous study, guanidinylated O-carboxymethyl chitosan (GOCMCS) was synthesised
by converted guanidinos with aminos of OCMCS (Scheme 1),
and the results had been proved that GOCMCS could improve
the transfection efficiency compared with OCMCS [20].
Parenteral administration of siRNA has challenges due to
nuclease degradation and renal clearance in the systemic circulation [21]. At current stage, most of non-viral gene therapy systems applied in clinical trials are through intravenous

and subcutaneous administration route. Only a few drug delivery systems are administered nasally [22]. Pulmonary administration takes the advantage of low drug dosage, quick
absorption, bioavailability, stability and proves to be a patientfriendly delivery system [23,24]. Pulmonary administration includes aerosolized inhalation, metered-dose inhalation, and
dry powder inhalation. The inhalation devices include nebulizers, pressurized metered dose inhalers(pMDIs) and dry
powder inhalers (DPIs). Each type of inhalation device has its
advantages and disadvantages [21].
The objective of this study was to develop nanoparticles
with core–shell structure based on PBAE and GOCMCS for successful pulmonary delivery of siRNA. Scheme 2 shows the
structure of the nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were prepared based on electrostatic self-assembly and the stability
of the formulations were evaluated by gel retardation. The cytotoxicity, cell uptake and gene knockdown efficiency of these
nanoparticles were tested in A549 cells. The aerodynamic behavior of nebulized nanoparticles were also assessed.

The qRT-PCR quantitation kit, FAM labeled siRNA, negative
control siRNA (siNC) and survivin siRNA (siSurvivin) were synthesized by GenePharm (Shanghai, China).

2.2.

Cell lines and culture conditions

A549(the human lung adenocarcinoma cells) were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere in complete RPMI1640
medium (containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and
100 μg/ml streptomycin).

2.3.

Preparation and characterization of nanoparticles

Appropriate amounts of PBAE (1 mg/ml) solution was mixed
with siRNA (100 ng/μl) solution and vortexed for 10 s. Then
PBAE/siRNA complexes were incubated at room temperature for 20 min to allow self-assembly. To prepare GOCMCS
coated complexes, GOCMCS solution (1 mg/ml) was added
to binary complexes at various weight ratio (50:1:20, PBAE:
siRNA: GOCMCS,w/w/w), then, mixed well and incubated for
another 20 min at room temperature [15]. The particles size
and zeta-potential of PBAE/siRNA/GOCMCS complexes were
determined with the dynamic light scattering technique (DLS)
with a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Malvern,
UK).
PBAE/siRNA/GOCMCS complexs binding assay were confirmed by gel electrophoresis.
First, 1% agarose gel was prepared by dissolving agarose
in 1 × TAE buffer(made of 40 mM Tris, 20 mM Acetate and
1 mM EDTA), the gel was heated to melt completely. and 1 × JJ
Red was added in the gel. The previous nanoparticles were
mixed with 6 × loading buffer (0.15% Bromophenol Blue, 0.15%
xylenecyanol ff, 5 mmol/l EDTA and 50% Glycerol) and DEPC
water was used to adjust the total volume. All the samples
were loaded on each well (100 ng siRNA per well), and electrophoresed at a constant voltage of 100 V for 20 min. Finally,
the gel was visualized by UV illumination and photoed by Gel
imaging system.
The protection against RNase A degradation assay was
detected by agarose gel electrophoresis [25]. Naked siRNA
and siRNA-loaded nanoparticles was incubated with RNase A
(25 mg/ml, 37 °C) for 24 h, respectively. At predetermined time
interval (0 h, 0.5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 12 h, 24 h), 20 μl of the sample was
removed and put into hot water at 80 °C to stop the reaction,
and amounts of sodium heparin were added to release free
siRNA.
To investigate the stability of PBAE/siRNA/GOCMCS
nanoparticles in fetal bovine serum (FBS) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), the nanoparticles and naked siRNA

123

were incubated with 10% FBS or BALF at 37 °C at certain
time interval (0 h,0.5 h,2 h,4 h,12 h,18 h), naked siRNA was
set as negative control. After all the samples were collected,
heparin was added into each sample to detach siRNA from
the nanoparticles. SiRNA integrity was investigated by the gel
electrophoresis.

2.4.
Nebulization of formulations and aerodynamic
behavior
The siRNA-loaded nanoparticles were nebulized by using Omron NE-C801 (Kyoto, Japan) to deliver into lung. To assess the
integrity of the siRNA-loaded nanoparticles after nebulization,
gel electrophoresis was carried out. The naked siRNA was set
as negative control. siRNA-loaded nanoparticles and naked
siRNA were compared before and after nebulization respectively.
Aerosol performance was measured by using a twostage impinger (TSI) according to Chinese Pharmacopoeia.
First, the FITC-loaded GOCMCS was synthesized as previous
studies [20]. Then PBAE/siRNA/FITC-GOCMCS nanoparticles
(50:1:20,w/w/w) was prepared as mentioned above. Then, the
prepared nanoparticles were move into the nebulizer reservoir which attached to TSI. Adjust the flow rate to 60 ± 5 l/min
using vacuum pump. After TSI test, the aerosol formulations
were collected completely. The fluorescence intensity of FITClabeled nanoparticles in every stages was measured respectively at excitation wavelengths of 492 nm and emission wavelengths 518 nm by automatic microplate reader (POLARstar
Omega, BMG, Germany). Fine particle fraction (FPF) was defined as the amount of FITC-loaded nanoparticles in Stage2
(mass median aerodynamic diameter < 6.4 lm) as percentage
of the total nanoparticles released into the TSI.

2.5.

In vitro cytotoxicity assay

FAM-labeled siRNA was used in order to be able to detect by flow cytometry (MACSQuant Analyzer 10, Miltenyi,
Germany). PBAE/FAM-siRNA/GOCMCS nanoparticles was prepared as previous, briefly, FAM-labeled siRNA (50 nM) was
added into PBAE solutions (1 mg/ml) at a weight ratio of 50:1,
then vortexed 10 s and incurbated at 37 °C for 30 min in
the dark to prepare PBAE/FAM-siRNA binary nanoparticles.
To prepare PBAE/FAM-siRNA/GOCMCS ternary nanoparticles,
then, added the binary nanoparticles dropwise into GOCMCS
(1 mg/ml) solution, and then incubated at room temperature
for another 30 min in the dark.
A549 cells were seeded on 96-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/ml,
cultured in complete medium RPMI1640 for 24 h.The medium
was replaced with free RPMI 1640 (200 μl) which contained
PBAE/FAM-siRNA/GOCMCS nanoparticles at various concentration (10 μg/ml, 25 μg/ml, 50 μg/ml and 200 μg/ml). After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, the medium was changed with MTT
solution (180 μl free RPMI 1640 and 20 μl MTT (1 mg/ml)), continue incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Then removed the medium,
and added 200 μl DMSO, incubated for another 10 min. Using enzyme standard instrument to measure absorbance at
490 nm.

Cellular uptake and mechanisms

A549 cells was seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105
cells/ml and incubated for 12 h. Cells were washed with PBS,
and the medium was replaced with free RPMI 1640 which contained PBAE/FAM-siRNA nanoparticles (50:1, w/w), PBAE/FAMsiRNA/GOCMCS nanoparticles (50:1:20, w/w/w) respectively,
and incubated for 6 h. Then the media was removed, the
cells were washed twice with PBS, harvested with trypsin,
centrifuged, re-suspended in PBS, and then analyzed by flow
cytometry instrument to assay the cellular uptake ability.
Furthermore, fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX53, Japan)
was used to qualitatively observe the cells uptake. A549 cells
were transfected with PBAE/FAM-siRNA/GOCMCS nanoparticles for 6 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained with
Hoechst 33342.
To obtain the best time when the mean fluorescence intensity for the cellular uptake was biggest, the cells were incubated with the PBAE/FAM-siRNA/GOCMCS nanoparticles for
series time (2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 24 h), other operations are similar with
cellular uptake assay.
To study the endocytosis pathway of PBAE/FAMsiRNA/GOCMCS nanoparticles, cells were pre-incubated
at 4 °C or incubated with endocytic inhibitors at 37 °C for
30 min. The endocytic inhibitors we used were sodium azide
(1 mg/ml), chlorpromazine (10 mg/ml), hypertonic sucrose
(450 mM), genistein (200 μM), filipin (5 μg/ml), amiloride
(13.3 μg/ml) [20]. Then the cells were incubated with
PBAE/FAM-siRNA/GOCMCS nanoparticles for another 4 h.
Finally, the cells were subjected to flow cytometry analysis.

2.7.

Apoptosis of A549 cells

A549 cells were seeded on 6-well plates and cultured
overnight for attachment. Then the medium was replaced
with free RPMI 1640 that contained PBAE/siSurvivin/GOCMCS
nanoparticles, and incubated for 6 h, then replaced the solution with free RPMI 1640, and cultured for another 42 h. Finally,
the cells were washed twice with PBS, detached by trypsin
without EDTA, collected, centrifuged, and resuspend twice
with PBS. Ultimately, the cells were suspended in 300 μl binding buffer, added 5 μl Annexin V-FITC for 15 min and further
stained with PI before analyzed by flow cytometry instrument.
All the operation need to be done in the dark. Cells incubated
only with medium and cells incubated with naked siSurvivin
were set as the control.

2.8.

Gene silencing experiment

The gene silencing efficiency of PBAE/siSurvivin/GOCMCS
nanoparticles were determined by quantitative real time
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. After the cells
reaching 70%–80% confluence, the culture medium was
changed with fresh complete medium respectively containing mocks, PBAE/siNC/GOCMCS nanoparticles, and aminePBAE/siSurvivin/GOCMCS nanoparticles. After incubating for
6 h, the medium contained samples were replaced with fresh
serum-free medium, and further cultured for another 42 h.

Then the cells were washed with PBS and lysed by Trizol
reagent. The isolated total RNA was quantified by micro UV
Spectrophotometer Nano 100 (All for life science, China) at
260 nm. RT-PCR was performed by using the SYBR Green I
dye method. The data was analyzed by using the comparative
CT(2−CT ) method.

Results and discussion

3.1.

Formation and characterization of nanoparticles

The particle size and the zeta potential of various formulation with various weight ratio and concentration were
determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The best
particle size was 153.8 ± 12.54 nm, and the zeta potential
was + 12.2 ± 4.94 mV when PBAE/siRNA/GOCMCS nanoparticles was 50:1:20(w/w/w, 1 mg/ml, 100 ng/μl, 1 mg/ml). A good
gene delivery system must be able to bind to siRNA, and
condense it into nanoparticles. To investigate the condensation ability of PBAE/siRNA/GOCMCS nanoparticles, agarose gel
retardation electrophoresis assay was performed at various
weight ratio(PBAE/siRNA). In our study, 50 nM naked siRNA
was set as control, as the optimal transfection concentration of siRNA is in the range of 50–100 nM for in vitro experiments [26]. As shown in Fig. 1A, the complete retardation of
siRNA mobility in the nanoparticles was achieved when the
weight ratio was 50:1:20 (PBAE/siRNA/GOCMCS), at this point,
the quantity of siRNA was 250 nM.
As shown in Fig. 1B, naked siRNA degraded rapidly and
could not be observed within 0.5 h after it was incubated
with RNase A. However, PBAE/siRNA/GOCMCS nanoparticles
could be observed for a few hours. These results suggested
that a certain amount of the siRNA was encapsulated into
the nanoparticles, and the nanoparticles protected the siRNA
from RNase A degradation.
In order to investigate the stability of the nanoparticles in
lung and serum, naked siRNA and siRNA-loaded the nanoparticles were incubated with serum or BALF for 18 h. As Fig. 1C
shown, naked siRNA and siRNA-loaded nanoparticles both
could be observed after incubation in BALF for 18 h. Naked
siRNA was hardly detected after incubation with serum for
12 h, while under the protection of the nanoparticles, the integrity of siRNA was maintained for 18 h (or longer). That is to
say, the integrity of siRNA in serum was enhanced for the protection of nanoparticles compared with naked siRNA. Importantly, the results also suggested that siRNA was more stable
in lung than in serum and indicated that it was more suitable
for pulmonary delivery.

3.2.
Nebulization of formulations and aerodynamic
behavior
The nanoparticles were nebulized with Omron NE-C801 (Kyoto, Japan). The integrity of the siRNA after and before nebulization was evaluated by gel electrophoresis assays. As shown
in Fig. 1D, the integrity of naked siRNA was decreased after
nebulization (Fig. 1D, lane 2) due to the thermal energy generating from the process of nebulization [27]. The band of

was no significant difference between the aerodynamic performance of PBAE/FITC-GOCMCS nanoparticles and that of
PBAE/siRNA/FITC-GOCMCS nanoparticles. Hence, the loading of siRNA had no effect on the aerodynamic behavior
of nanoparticles. The high FPF of PBAE/siRNA/FITC-GOCMCS
nanoparticles suggested that this delivery system is suitable
for deep lung deposition and could serve as potential candidate for siRNA pulmonary delivery.

the siRNA-loaded nanoparticles was retarded in the well after nebulization (Fig. 1E, lane 2), and a bright and clear band
of siRNA could also be observed after using heparin to dissociate nanoparticles (Fig. 1E, lane 4). The results suggested that
siRNA can be successfully loaded into nanoparticles to overcome the shear force of aerosolization process and conserve
its integrity.
FITC was used to quantify the concentration of the
nanoparticles, FITC-labeled GOCMCS had been synthesized
in previous study [20]. PBAE/siRNA/FITC-labeled GOCMCS
nanoparticles were prepared as previous described. The portion of nanoparticles deposited in the stage 2 of impinger, representing the FPF of nanoparticles, was quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity in every stages. As shown
in Fig. 2., the FPF of PBAE/FITC-GOCMCS nanoparticles and
PBAE/siRNA/FITC-GOCMCS nanoparticles were 59.2% ± 3.4%
and 57.8% ± 2.6%, respectively (P > 0.05), indicating that there

Cytotoxicity assay

The basic cytotoxicity caused by the nanoparticles was evaluated in A549 cells by MTT assay, as presented in Fig. 3A,
the PBAE/siNC nanoparticles showed low cytotoxicity. Although the same quantity of PBAE was utilized for gene
complexation, PBAE/siNC /GOCMCS nanoparticles showed
numerical slightly lower toxicity than PBAE/siNC nanoparticles. It was worth noting that cell viability was higher than
80% for the nanoparticles in contrast with PEI. Statistical analysis was performed using t-test and it had been proved that
there was no significant difference between the cell viability
of PBAE/siNC/GOCMCS nanoparticles and that of PBAE/siNC
nanoparticles. It proved that PBAE can bind siRNA to form stable nanoparticles with low cytotoxicity, and it is a promising
agent for non-viral gene delivery [28,29].

3.4.

Cellular uptake and mechanisms

The cellular uptake of the siRNA was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively via flow cytometric methods (Fig. 3B)
and fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 4), respectively. As shown
in Fig. 3B, the cellular uptake efficiency of PBAE/FAM-siRNA/
GOCMCS nanoparticles was higher than PBAE/FAM-siRNA
nanoparticles. The results proved that the group of guanidine
has the similar effect of CPPs which promoted the uptake of
the nanoparticles. On the other hand, GOCMCS balanced the
positive charge of the nanoparticles, therefore, the nanoparticles was easily endocytosis into the cells [30]. Compared with
PBAE/FAM-siRNA nanoparticles (Fig. 4A), the strongest green
color in the merged image (Fig. 4B) represented that to some
extents successful qualitative cellular uptake took place by
the PBAE/FAM-siRNA/GOCMCS nanoparticle.

PBAE/siRNA nanoparticles, (B) PBAE/siRNA/GOCMCS
nanoparticles. Images showed fluorescent overlay of siRNA
(green, FAM-labeled) and nuclear (blue, Hoechst33342stained).

The nanoparticles exhibited time-dependent cellular uptake upon incubation. As shown in Fig. 3C, the highest cellular uptake efficiency was at 6 h, When the time prolonged to
24 h, the uptake efficiency had no obvious increase, this may
be due to the cellular uptake of the nanoparticles had reached
saturation, or FAM-siRNA was degraded and the fluorescence
quenched gradually. Thus, the cellular uptake time was set at
6 h.
Endocytic inhibitors were applied to investigate the endocytosis pathways of the nanoparticles to delivery into the
cell. Energy dependent processes endocytic pathways can be
inhibited by low temperature and sodium azide which is
an ATPase inhibitor. Clathrin dependent endocytosis can be
inhibited by hypertonic sucrose and chlorpromazine. Filipin
and genistein can be used as the inhibitors for caveolae dependent endocytosis. Amiloride can block macropinocytosis
[31]. As shown in Fig. 3D, when the cell was incubated with
sodium azide or at 4 °C, there revealed an significant inhibitory effects. This result indicated that the delivery of the
nanoparticles was energy-dependent endocytosis. When the

cells were incubated with chlorpromazine and hypertonic sucrose (clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibitors) the cellular
uptake level of the nanoparticles was relatively lower than filipin and genistein (caveolae-mediated endocytosis inhibitors).
The uptake level of samples was lower than 70%. Therefore,
clathrin-mediated and caveolae-dependent endocytosis both
involved in mediating the cellular uptake of the nanoparticles,
but more dependent on clathrin mediated endocytosis pathway.

3.5.

Apoptosis of A549 cells

The apoptotic effect of the survivin siRNA carried by
PBAE/GOCMCS nanoparticles was determined qualitatively
using Annexin V/PI double staining assay [32]. The results
were evaluated by flow cytometry (MACSQuant Analyzer 10,
Miltenyi, Germany). The apoptotic cells are shown on Fig. 5A.
Q1 indicated necrotic cells (UL), Q2 the late apoptotic cells
(UR) Q3 early apoptotic cells (LR) and Q4 indicated the living cells (LL), each groups calculated cell number in the form
percentage. The sum of Q2 and Q3 represented cell apoptosis rate, thus, the survivin siRNA introduced in the A549 cell
by PBAE/GOCMCS nanoparticles caused 26.83% ± 0.59% (P <
0.01) apoptosis cells compared with siNC-loaded nanoparticles treated group. The reason why the apoptosis increased
might be attributed to the high cellular uptake efficiency into
A549 cells.

30.93% ± 2.27% (P < 0.001) in survivin mRNA level when
treated with PBAE/siSurvivin/GOCMCS nanoparticles. These
results suggested that PBAE/GOCMCS nanoparticles would be
a promising gene delivery vector.

Conclusions

In summary, we have developed promising PBAE/siRNA/
GOCMCS ternary nanoparticles based on electrostatical coatings as an efficient non-viral gene delivery system with excellent biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo. The addition
of GOCMCS markedly performed high cellular uptake in
A549, and the PBAE/siRNA/GOCMCS ternary complexes presented higher gene transfection efficiency in vitro and in vivo
than the PBAE/siRNA binary complexes. It is concluded that
PBAE/siRNA/GOCMCS may be a applicable gene delivery strategy of therapeutic genes to treat tumor in vivo.
